UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy  condemned Israel' conduct  Gaza  said that Britain could " more   coming weeks"   Israeli government does  change    pursuing     strip. He expressed anger that  "international community   been able  bring this    "  said   "sickened"   killings  Palestinians   centres  Israeli forces  recent days. Since Israel began  military campaign  Gaza after  7 October attacks, significant public attention  focused   issue  assistance provided   UK. Much   weaponry used  Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) strikes   strip  been built  sold  Western nations. But information around  extent   UK' military support  Israel often remains unclear  classified,  some MPs have called   public inquiry into  extent   assistance.

Does  UK supply Israel with arms?

The UK     Israel' main suppliers  arms. The US     biggest seller - helping Israel develop    world' most advanced militaries - followed  Germany  Italy. Since 2015,  UK  approved arms export licences  Israel worth over £500m ($676.4m) - peaking  2018, according  Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) pressure group. However, much   attention around  UK' support  Israel  focussed  parts made  Britain   F-35 . A state--- multi-role fighter,   been used extensively  Israel  strike Gaza. The UK supplies between 13-15%   components used   , including ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers  weapon release cables. After  Labour Party came  power last year,  suspended 30   350 arms export licences, affecting equipment such  parts  fighter jets, helicopters  drones. Any UK company that wants  sell arms abroad must apply   licence,   government said   time that there   "clear risk"  equipment could  used  commit serious violations  international . But crucially, parts   F-35 were  included   export . The government said  could  prevent Israel obtaining these components  they  sent  manufacturing centres abroad  part   global programme -  directly  Israel.

Professor Anna Stavrianakis,  expert  UK Arms Export, described  government' decision  allow  this exemption  " enormous loophole". "UK-made parts   F-35 mostly    USA, where they  incorporated into jets bound  Israel,"  told BBC Verify, noting that because  White House "does  want  stop supporting Israel",  UK export bans were quite limited  their effectiveness. The UK also -developed  Hermes drone, which  been widely used  Gaza. While  UK version   aircraft, called  Watchkeeper 450,  unarmed,  Israeli-made Hermes drone   armed with Spike missiles   reportedly used   attack that killed seven World Central Kitchen  workers last year. It  hard   what  UK  still exporting  Israel under  active licences. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said last year that      "blanket    arms embargo"  said  remained essential that Israel could defend itself from attack. According   Department  Business  Trade, 161   extant licences relate  military products. A UK Parliament report said that  remaining licences could include "items such  trainer aircraft  naval equipment,  dual- items  civilian   telecoms  data equipment".

Has  UK shared intelligence with Israel?

The extent  which  UK  shared intelligence with Israel since  7 October attacks  unclear. The government   long-standing "defence partnership with Israel" which defence officials  includes "education, joint training  capability development". The Royal Air Force (RAF)  flown hundreds  surveillance flights over Gaza since December 2023, reportedly using Shadow R1  planes based   RAF base  Akrotiri  nearby Cyprus. In  interview  Monday, Lammy insisted that  RAF flights over Gaza have     sharing   military intelligence with  IDF. "It would  quite wrong   British government  assist   prosecution  this   Gaza,"  foreign secretary said. "We   doing that."

In 2023  UK acknowledged that some   "unarmed" drones circling over  strip were aiding   search  Israeli hostages taken  Hamas during  7 October attacks. There  50 people still held  Hamas, with 20 believed   alive. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard reaffirmed that stance  April 2025, telling MPs that UK drone flights over Gaza were being conducted with  "sole purpose  locating hostages". The Ministry  Defence (MoD)  refused  comment  whether Israeli aircraft have access   RAF' base  Cyprus. But BBC Verify also identified Israeli Air Force planes  UK airspace over  past year after reports   independent outlet DropSite. Several Re' refuelling planes appeared  specialised flight tracking sites over RAF bases  Brize Norton  Fairford. An MoD spokesperson told BBC Verify: "It  standard practice  routinely authorise requests  limited numbers  allies  partners  access  UK'  bases." "We cannot comment   provide information relating  foreign nations' military aircraft movements  operations,"  spokesperson added.

Are Israeli troops training   UK?

The UK often runs training courses   militaries  allied nations, many  which focus  leadership, logistics  cyber-operations. For example, thousands  Ukrainian troops have come  Britain since Russia launched  full-scale invasion  2022  basic training.

National Urban League says Trump' policies amount  emergency  Black Americans

One   nation' oldest Civil Rights organization warns  Trump administration' policies have thrust  country into  "state  emergency"  antidiscrimination policies, personal freedoms  black economic advancement.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

For 49 years,  National Urban League  released  report  calls  State  Black America. This year,  title  State  Emergency: Democracy, Civil Rights And Progress Under Attack. What does  mean that    country' oldest civil rights groups   declaring  emergency  Black Americans? Marc Morial  president  CEO   National Urban League. Welcome back   program.

MARC MORIAL: Great   with .

SUMMERS: I want  start  with that question. Briefly describe    state  emergency  Black America that    spell   this report.

MORIAL: There'  unprecedented attack   gains   last 70 years. And think about . Seventy years , Brown .  Board  Education began  dismantling  segregation  America. Ten years later,  passage   Civil Rights Act. For  first time, there were legal protections against discrimination  fact,  just discrimination  . That effort  being attacked viciously . And what -    being attacked? - voter suppression,  attack  equal opportunity under  guise that somehow equal opportunity  discriminatory    itself - that'   attacks  DE  I  -   cutbacks  government initiatives  programs - whether ' Medicaid, food stamps, education, veterans' benefits - that help make America stronger  better  create opportunity  . Taken together,   last  months, ' seen  most aggressive assault   progress ' made  modern American history.

SUMMERS: There'     into here,  I just want  pull apart some   specifics  mentioned -    policies supporting diversity, equity  inclusion, which I' note  been happening    years . To your mind, what  changed since people  oppose these types  policies came into power   federal government  2025?

MORIAL: Think about  executive orders that seek  shut down  enforcement mechanisms,  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,  Department  Education   complete change  mission   Civil Rights Division. All  these specific things when taken together just simply represent  assault   idea  equal opportunity,   idea  racial justice,   idea , , diversity, equity  inclusion, which   strength  America -  powerful, powerful strength  America. And that    many   have   stand   very strong effort  resist through  courts. Some  protesting. We' doing everything possible    slow down this movement,     movement. It' called  MAGA movement. You  call  that. But ' bigger than politics because    broad-based assault, using public policy   weapon against equal opportunity.

SUMMERS: I - well,  mentioned  Department  Justice' Civil Rights Division here,  I just want  present  with something that  department posted   social media site X, formerly known  Twitter. They point  that  Civil Rights Division " returned  enforcing    written fairly, equally  without political agenda,"  quote. How   read that?

MORIAL: It'  bogus argument. It'  cover story. It'  smokescreen behind  effort  weaponize  Civil Rights Division. Why would  suspend   civil rights cases that were pending when  took office? Why would    court  Louisville  suggest that  officer   been convicted   crime   - sentence  shooting into someone' home, after  jury that heard  evidence said  violated  civil rights, ...

SUMMERS: You' talking there about  case related...

MORIAL: ...Sentencing guidelines...

SUMMERS: ...To  killing  Breonna Taylor.

MORIAL: Of Breonna Taylor,  -  sentencing guidelines recommend  sentence  multiple years. The department' rhetoric rings hollow with many   because what  understand  that    diversion. It  trying  divert people away from  real facts,  that they' saying '  going  prosecute police officers  violate people' civil rights. We'  going  attack corruption  police departments -  systemic,   will, corruption  brutality. Instead, ' going    Civil Rights Division  wage    political enemies.

SUMMERS: Harrison Fields, '  White House spokesman,  said that civil rights groups that oppose  Trump administration aren' -  I' quoting Harrison Fields here - "aren' advancing anything  hate  division, while  president  focused  uniting  country." Marc Morial, this administration  repeatedly touted  tried  showcase efforts  promote what  calls meritocracy ,  argues , equality  opportunity. What   make  that?

MORIAL: The  , merit  ? And what civil rights laws  about  merit  everyone. In other words, give everyone with merit  opportunity. Historically,  this country,   . Merit meant white . That' what  meant  fact,  that    country  organized until  civil rights laws  passed.

SUMMERS: What would  like    response  these actions ' been discussing from  Trump administration? What'  playbook?

MORIAL: Well, I think ' going  require  change  policy. It' going  require  change  approach. We'  going   that with  Trump administration, clearly. So I think  roads  going  lead   next   elections  this country, where Americans  going  have  vote  what they believe  policy   approach ought   when  comes  civil rights  equal opportunity.

SUMMERS: This report   State  Black America,  I just want   , what   hope that  Americans   races take away from this report?

MORIAL: I' glad  asked that question because  many respects, while    State  Black America report,   more  state   union report  this climate. The attacks   rule  ,  attacks - ' just take diversity, equity  inclusion. Diversity, equity  inclusion benefits women - women   races -   substantially benefited white women. It benefits Latinos. It' benefited those   disabled. It' benefited large, large numbers  Asians. I mean,  concept  diversity  been about taking those ' been locked , left   marginalized  giving them  real opportunity  advance into  American mainstream. And  this report    Americans. We should understand  founding fathers said that  hold these truths   self-evident that  people  created equal. If those principles mean something, then  more diverse America,  more inclusive America   .

SUMMERS: We' been speaking with Marc Morial,  president  CEO   National Urban League. Thank   much.

MORIAL: Hey, thank   having , always.

Have  girls   boys? Study suggests  odds aren' 50/50

Couples ' been surprised   string  baby boys  baby girls could  forgiven  wondering whether  odds   offspring lottery  more than just pure chance. A  study  Harvard University researchers that examines  birthing records  58,007 women suggests their hunch might  correct.

The authors   study, published   journal Science Advances last week, found that instead  straight 50/50 odds between boys  girls with each birth,  offspring  families with  least three children tend  follow what scientists call  "weighted coin toss," indicating that each family  have  distinct tendency toward girls  boys.

"We' seeing     having only boys  girls," says Siwen Wang,  doctoral student   Harvard T.H. Chan School  Public Health   lead author   study. That    colleagues  wonder "whether ' simply  chance,   there  underlying biology explaining these  clustering within families?"

They analyzed data from  second  third iteration   Nurses' Health Study, which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across  U.S. from 1956  2015.

They found that   first  children born   family  girls,  chances   third child also being  girl  higher than    —  this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true   first   boys: The likelihood  having another  increases,   trend persists through later births.

"Notably,  families with three boys (MMM),  probability  having another   61%;  families with three girls (FFF),  probability  having another girl  58%,"  study authors wrote.

Looking   possible explanation, "   things that stands     first birth — that' associated with  moderately higher chance  having only boys  girls," Wang says. "If ' starting your family younger than 23 ... [there ] around  40% chance  having  same- family,"  says. If  woman begins having children after  28, ' around 50% —  relatively small  statistically significant difference.

The researchers excluded families with only  child  pregnancies ending  miscarriage, stillbirth  twins. Women with  history  infertility treatments were also left    study. To avoid bias from parents  stopped having children after reaching  preferred  ratio,  researchers   count each woman' final birth   analysis.

The researchers speculate that  older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into  results  that changes  vaginal acidity might favor  survival  sperm carrying either  Y (boys)  X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal  paternal ages  often correlated,  father'  might also play  role. Since  study included only women,  authors emphasize that  exact mechanism remains uncertain.

"We ' have data about  ," Wang says. "We ' have data about  genetics  even very precise characteristics ... which  obviously important   determination."

It'  concern also raised  Mark Gerstein,  professor  Yale University  wasn' involved   research. Gerstein specializes  applying computational approaches  molecular biology. "Given  disparity observed  mothers   study,  could easily envision  equally impactful relationship with either  genetics     father,"  says. "This seems like  promising area  future research  explore."

Ralph Catalano,  emeritus professor  public health   University  California, Berkeley,  also wasn' involved   research, thinks that  study' narrow focus    birth   show  full picture. "Fewer than 50%  conceptions reach birth. More than 50%  spontaneously aborted [miscarried],  that'   random draw,"  says.

Due  immunological  developmental sensitivity, females  more likely   spontaneously aborted early  pregnancy, while males  more vulnerable  spontaneous abortion later  pregnancy because they  physically frailer,  says. "The   infants   — those  make   birth —  shaped  much   utero selection     conception,"  says.

Another caveat   composition   sample. The Nurses' Health Study that  sample  drawn from  made   overwhelmingly white women residing   United States. "Since  preferences  reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions,  countries …   ratio distribution pattern observed   study   apply  other societies,"  researchers acknowledge.

The groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication  accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For  democracy  endure  another 250 years,  hopefully much longer,  must share  commitment  facts… Today represents  ringing endorsement  truth   democracy.”

The right-wing network said   statement that  “acknowledge[]  Court’ rulings finding certain claims about Dominion   false,” referring  Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged  presidential election. But Fox ’ have  admit - that  spread lies about Dominion,  Dominion representative told CNN.

The $787.5 million payout  roughly half   $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though   nearly 10 times  company’ valuation from 2018,  roughly eight times  annual revenue  2021, according  court filings.

The witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch,  CEO  Lachlan Murdoch,   Fox hosts like Sean Hannity  Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts,  deposition testimony made public during  case revealed that these figures,  many others  Fox, privately said  2020 that  vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But  lies were spread - anyway.

Rupert Murdoch thought  election denialism  “really crazy,” even  Fox personalities peddled those same claims  millions  viewers. Carlson said  “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency   “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers,  senior executives privately said   - claims   stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless”  “mind-blowingly nuts.”

These revelations generated months  blistering headlines  Fox   case moved toward trial. By settling , Fox deprived Dominion  chance  further expose  dishonesty with  weeks-long trial.

Fox News  Fox Corporation –  parent company, which  also  defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion,    case   meritless assault  First Amendment press freedoms.

Dramatic days  Delaware

But when  proceedings didn’ promptly resume after lunch,  chances   deal seemed  rise   minute, even though   lawyers from both sides    courtroom, looking  their phones,  waiting.

The racially diverse jury      women  brought back into  court, ready  their front- seat   historic trial. But Davis,  judge, instead told  panel they helped spur  settlement.

“Your presence here, short compared  what  thought,  uneventful   certain sense,  extremely important,” Davis said. “Without ,  parties would  have been able  resolve their situation.”

Many   Dominion side cast  settlement   victory  democracy   truth itself.

“Fox  admitted  telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage   company,  employees,   customers that  serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.

While  Dominion case   over, Fox News  still facing  second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that  similarly smeared  Fox News’ shows after  2020 election. That case  still   discovery process,   trial ’ expected anytime soon.

For  part, Dominion still  pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax  OAN,  well  against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell  Mike Lindell. They  deny wrongdoing.

CNN —

Millions  Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy  navigate    debt trap     President Joe Biden that  instead threatening  capture  House Republicans.

The California Republican traveled  Wall Street  Monday  deliver  fresh warning that  House GOP majority will refuse  lift    government borrowing unless Biden agrees  spending cuts that would effectively neutralize  domestic agenda  neuter  White House legacy.

McCarthy also assured traders, however, that  would never   US government default   obligations –  potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger  recession  unleash  cuts   fall   event that  debt ceiling   raised.

This  where  risk  Americans comes . It’ hard     rookie speaker, with  tiny majority   conference containing plenty  extremists,  engineer either  these outcomes.

Most countries ’ require  legislature  raise  government’ borrowing threshold. But  quirky situation   US  made  once routine duty  opportunity  political mischief   polarized . Since  government spends more than  makes  revenue,  must borrow money  service  debt    spending that Congress  already authorized. It   problem getting more credit since  US pays  bills   always   stellar credit rating, despite  previous downgrade from  threat  default.

At least, that’     worked until .

McCarthy beseeched  conference   closed-door meeting  Tuesday  line  behind  bill that would raise  debt limit   year  require  flurry  spending concessions from Biden. He styled  measure   initial   forcing  president   negotiating table. But  bill  purely tactical since ’   chance  passing  Democratic- Senate.

But   sign   difficult  will    speaker  even pull this gambit , there were signs  internal disagreement  what should    package among GOP members.

Rep. Scott Perry,  chairman   hardline House Freedom Caucus,  frustrated about  lack  specificity   plan  wanted steeper cuts.

“I ’ know what’   package completely. That’  issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant  commit  . Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’ Manu Raju, “I’ open    I’ still  ‘’ vote.”

It   unusual  various factions   congressional majority  haggle over details before  final package  agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry,  McCarthy ally,  confident  plan would pass  House. “The question , what does  White House then  once  pass this package? We’ clearly stated there   clean debt ceiling that will pass  House,”  added. “So ’ have  first opening offer here. And ’    president’ willing  come   table  negotiate like previous presidents have.”

McHenry’ comment, however, reflected   flaw   GOP strategy since  relies  McCarthy’ belief that Biden will have  choice   come   table. The White House  insisted  House should     pass  simple bill that only raises  borrowing limit

In effect, McCarthy  already    severe test   leadership since there’  guarantee that   pass  measure   House where   only lose four votes   which there   signs  fractious GOP  agree  what programs      much. And even   measure does squeeze through  House   coming weeks,  will likely   idealized Republican product  which Biden   Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter  GOP support.

Still,  speaker  typically bullish when  predicted Monday ’ have  votes  pass  initial bill.

“I think   218  raise  debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’     consensus within  conference. We’  together  work through .”

His assurances    very reassuring, however, because  similarly blithe predictions that    votes    speakership  January degenerated into  farcical process that   make huge concessions   party’ most radical members  required 15 ballots before  finally      dreams.

But with  debt ceiling,  will  Americans’ livelihoods   global economy, rather than McCarthy’ immediate political ambitions, that    line.

Republicans    agree  their  demands

So , Republicans seem   having trouble negotiating with themselves,  alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson  South Dakota,   helping  fashion  GOP’ position, said that while  party hopes  pass  initial bill next week, challenges remain.

“I think  hardest part  just that there   unlimited number  conservative policy victories that,  course,   want   worked ,” Johnson told CNN’ Manu Raju. “The reality  that   negotiation,  never  everything  want. And  I think  biggest issue right      squeeze these thousands  desires down   manageable  credible number  asks?”

Another complication  that some members   Republican conference have said they will never vote  raise  debt ceiling  principle –  matter what. In  powerful Republican majority such holdouts could  ignored. In McCarthy’ narrow majority – secured after  2022 midterm election that fell short  GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive  help McCarthy    event  GOP defections since they’ presumably have  vote  huge cuts that Biden  opposed   final GOP bill. And  speaker probably couldn’ risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing   rule,   battled    , that lets  single member call  vote   ouster.

The coming showdown over  debt ceiling  potentially  defining moment   -year period  uneasy cohabitation between  Democratic president  Republican speaker. Neither Biden  McCarthy  afford  lose,   outcome will shape both their legacies.

Republicans  have less leverage than they think

There  nothing wrong with Republicans seeking    leverage they    democratic election    further their political goals  cutting public spending. There  some GOP lawmakers  sincerely worry about debt  deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty  economists worry about  always ballooning national debt, which  crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’  spending  Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures  health care programs triggered  debate  whether  worsened  inflation crisis.

But  Republicans choosing  right hill  this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans   economic well-being  millions   risk? The absolutist nature  McCarthy’ position pays little heed   delicate balance  power. Democrats control  White House   Senate,   handing Republicans  House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.

Republicans  also facing claims  hypocrisy, since they  little problem raising  debt limit when Donald Trump,  rarely worried about making   spending splash,  president. The 45th commander  chief  also  videotape dating   White House days saying  couldn’ believe anyone would   debt ceiling   “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats   office  often look  other  when there    their    Oval Office.

McCarthy needs  reverse  blame equation

In order  prevail  this fight, McCarthy   somehow change  political dynamic  saddling Biden with  blame   default   economic tensions that could begin  unfold even before  country plunges over  fiscal cliff.

He tried     Monday  insisting that  biggest threat   US economy wasn’  default  rising national debt.

“Without exaggeration American debt   ticking time bomb that will detonate unless  take serious responsible action. Yet,   President Biden reacted  this issue? He  done nothing. So   view,  I think  rest  America, ’ irresponsible,”  said.

Previous fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses  Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly  Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton  Barack Obama,  example, branded their foes   House  economic arsonists  thereby gained political traction.

McCarthy needs  reverse  equation, which   ’ trying  portray Biden  stubborn  refusing  negotiate concessions  raising  debt ceiling. The   haven’    last 75 days   White House  sticking   position that  place  talks  over  budget – which House Republicans    produce –   with  full faith  credit   US government   line  with America’ reputation   financial haven  stake.

McCarthy , therefore,   bind. Congress,   president,   power  raise  government’ borrowing limit. Yet  speaker  demanding Biden give away  store over  duty that only McCarthy   lawmakers  fulfill. No  would benefit from  default – especially   president likely heading into  reelection race. But ’ hard    McCarthy  emerge from this conundrum   winner   triggers  economic meltdown.

The White House twisted that particular knife  Monday.

“There   responsible solution   debt limit: addressing  promptly, without brinksmanship  hostage taking –  Republicans  three times   last administration   Presidents Trump  Reagan argued   office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.

Republicans   Senate have   tried  avoid  mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell   least give  colleague   House some moral support  Monday when  returned   Capitol after convalescing after  fall.

“President Biden does    stick  fingers   ears  refuse  listen, talk  negotiate. And  American people know that. The White House needs  stop wasting time  start negotiating with  Speaker   House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’ volunteer   involved.

McCarthy’ speech  Monday only furthered  impression that  damaging political crisis over  debt ceiling , after months  simmering, moving toward  boil.

As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  New York    Monday: “He went     Wall Street  gave   more details,  more facts,   information,  I’  blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues  this direction   headed  default.”

“In some schools there  little   misuse  stimulants, while  other schools more than 25%  students  used stimulants  nonmedical ways,” said McCabe,   also  professor  nursing   University  Michigan School  Nursing. “This study   major wake- call.”

Nonmedical uses  stimulants  include taking more than  normal dose   high,  taking  medication with alcohol  other drugs  boost  high, prior studies have found.

Students also overuse medications  “  pill that someone gave them    sense  stress around academics — they  trying  stay  late  study  finish papers,” said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director  pediatric programs   Yale Program  Addiction Medicine  New Haven, Connecticut.

“We know this  happening  colleges. A major takeaway    study  that misuse  sharing  stimulant prescription medications  happening  middle  high schools,  just college,” said Camenga,    involved with  study.

Wide range  abuse

Published Tuesday   journal JAMA Network Open,  study analyzed data collected between 2005  2020  Monitoring  Future,  federal survey that  measured drug  alcohol  among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.

In  data  used  this study, questionnaires were given  more than 230,000 teens  eighth, 10th  12th grades   nationally representative sample  3,284 secondary schools.

Schools with  highest rates  teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely  have students misusing prescription stimulants during  past year,  study found. Schools with    students currently using such treatments  much less   issue,   didn’ disappear, McCabe said.

“We know that   biggest sources  leftover medications, perhaps from family members such  siblings,  asking peers,   attend other schools,”  said.

In addition, adolescents  said they used ADHD medications currently    past were about 2.5% more likely  have misused  stimulants when compared with peers   never used stimulants,  study found.

“But these findings were  being driven solely  teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found  significant association, even when  excluded students  were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”

Data collection   study  through 2020. Since then,  statistics show prescriptions  stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most  groups. At  same time, there  been  nationwide shortage  Adderall,    most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable  fill  refill their prescriptions.

“Finally,  parents suspect  type  misuse, they should contact their child’ prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should  screened  assessed immediately.”

Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas  Tuesday amid reports that  Supreme Court conservative failed  disclose luxury travel, gifts   real estate transaction involving  GOP megadonor,  their plan  investigate  conservative jurist remains unclear.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin  promised that  committee will hold  hearing   alleged ethics violations   coming weeks,  shared  details when pressed  CNN  whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas  others  might have knowledge about  relationship with  donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.

Asked  subpoenas were   table, Durbin said that  decision  been made  that . He said that   “ soon”  share more information about what  committee’ hearing  Supreme Court ethics might look like. He  other Judiciary Democrats sent  letter  Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling    open  investigation into  Thomas allegations.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal,  Connecticut Democrat  sits   Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “ American people deserve    facts surrounding Justice Thomas’ blatant violation  .”

“I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear,   ,  should consider subpoenas    others, like Harlan Crow,  have information,” Blumenthal said.

Other Democrats   committee said Tuesday that they were deferring  Durbin,  huddled with Democrats  Monday evening  discuss their strategy towards Thomas.

Meanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united  defending  Thomas, suggesting  court  handle   affairs.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats  criticizing  court,  said   confidence  Roberts “ deal with these court internal issues.”

“The Democrats,  seems  , spent    time criticizing individual members   court  going after  court   institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.

Bringing more transparency   high court   some bipartisan support   past,   court’ jerk   right – particularly with  three justices that former President Donald Trump    bench –  raised  partisan stakes around  issue. In recent years,  conservative majority  handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling  regulations  reining   powers  executive branch agencies –  prompting outcry from Democrats.

Even  Senate Democrats have   settle   plan  their  response   Thomas allegations, they sought  highlight  issue  framed  within their broader push   code--ethics   Supreme Court, which  excluded from many   ethics rules that apply  lower rungs   federal judiciary.

“I’ disturbed   recent reports detailing potentially unethical – even potentially illegal conduct –   highest levels   judiciary,” Sen. Alex Padilla,  California Democrat, said   Judiciary Committee hearing  three lower court nominees  Tuesday. “It should  without saying that judges   levels should  held  strict  enforceable ethical standards.”

Durbin said   speech that Congress shouldn’ have  wait   court  .

“The Supreme Court doesn’ need  wait  Congress  clean   ;  justices could take action today  they wanted ,    court fails  , Congress must,” Durbin,  Illinois Democrat, said   Senate floor Tuesday.

Back- back-reports  ProPublica this month detailed  luxury travel  gifts  Thomas from Crow –  even  real estate transaction – went unreported  Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.

Thomas  said that  travel  gifts     family that were financed   Crows went unreported because   been advised that    required   , under  exemption   court’ disclosure rules  -called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny  those rules  lawmakers,  Judicial Conference – which operates   policy-making body   federal judiciary – recently closed  loophole  those rules that appears  have covered some   hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that  intended  follow that updated guidance   future,   source close   justice also told CNN  recent days that  planned  amend  disclosure form  report  real estate transaction,  sale   mother’ home  Crow.

“If  reports  accurate,  stinks,” Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening,  rare comments from  Republican criticizing Thomas’ lack  transparency.

Republicans defend Thomas   SCOTUS  address ethics internally

Other Republicans lined   defense   justice –   named   Supreme Court  President George H.W. Bush  1991 –  said  wasn’ Congress’ place  push  ethics code   high court.

Sen. Josh Hawley,  Republican member   Judiciary Committee, suggested that  accusations against Thomas were part   “multi-decade effort   target Clarence Thomas  these liberal activist groups.”

This    first time Thomas  been   center   ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that  wife Ginni Thomas,  conservative activist,  texting with Trump White House chief  staff Mark Meadows about  former president’ efforts overturn  2020 election defeat,   political lobbying  long raised questions about when justices  obligated  recuse themselves from cases.

Yet Republicans have shown little interest  joining Democrats  using legislation  impose  ethics code   justices.

“The Court, kind  historically I think,  sort  policed itself,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune,  GOP’ Senate Whip,  said Thomas  been  “solid justice   court through  years   acquitted himself well there.”

“Let’  what  court does,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Republican   Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. “I prefer them    internally.”

As time  passed, adults with reduced immune function because  their    underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose   bivalent vaccines.

High speed trains have proved their worth across  world over  past 50 years.

It’  just  reducing journey times,  more importantly, ’  driving economic growth, creating jobs  bringing communities closer together. China, Japan  Europe lead  .

So  doesn’  United States have  high-speed rail network like those?

For  richest  most economically successful nation   planet, with  increasingly urbanized population  more than 300 million, ’  position that  becoming more difficult  justify.

Although Japan started  trend with  Shinkansen “Bullet Trains”  1964,    advent  France’ TGV   early 1980s that really kick-started  global high-speed train revolution that continues  gather pace.

But ’  revolution that    bypassed  United States. Americans  still almost entirely reliant  congested highways   headache-inducing stress   airport  airline network prone  meltdowns.

China  built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers)  dedicated high-speed railways since 2008  plans   43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers)  2035.

Meanwhile,  United States  just 375 route-miles  track cleared  operation  more than 100 .

“Many Americans have  concept  high-speed rail  fail    value. They  hopelessly stuck with  highway  airline mindset,” says William C. Vantuono, editor--chief  Railway Age, North America’ oldest railroad industry publication.

Cars  airliners have dominated long-distance travel   United States since  1950s, rapidly usurping  network  luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such  “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief”  “Silver Comet.”

Deserted  Hollywood movie stars  business travelers, famous railroads such   New York Central were largely bankrupt   early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains  Amtrak,  national passenger train operator founded  1971.

In  decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems  have been  very  priority  US lawmakers.

Powerful airline,   auto industry lobbies  Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority,  their position  weakening   face  environmental concerns  worsening congestion.

Billions  rail improvements

US President Joe Biden’ $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill includes  unprecedented $170 billion  improving railroads.

Some  this will  invested  repairing Amtrak’ crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York  Washington.

There  also  plans  bring passenger trains back  many more cities across  nation – providing fast, sustainable travel  cities  regions that have  seen  passenger train  decades.

Add  this  success   privately funded Brightline operation  Florida, which  been given  green light  build  $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles  Las Vegas  2027, plus schemes  California, Texas   proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle  Vancouver,   United States  last appears     cusp   passenger rail revolution.

Bigger investment

“Every president since Ronald Reagan  talked about  pressing need  improve infrastructure across  USA,  they’ always  other, bigger priorities  deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer  train builder Alstom’ US division.

“But  there’  huge impetus   things moving – ’  time  optimism. If  build , they will come. As  industry, ’ maturing,  ’ ready  take  next step. It’ time  focus  passenger rail.”

Sherin points  that other public services such  highways  airports  “massively subsidized,”  there shouldn’   issue with doing  same  rail.

“We need    better   articulating  benefits  high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines –  that will help   build bipartisan support,”  adds. “High-speed rail    solution  everything,     place.”

Only Amtrak’ Northeast Corridor  trains that  travel  speeds approaching those   300 kilometers  hour (186 ) TGV  Shinkansen.

Even here, Amtrak Acela trains currently    150  –  only  short bursts. Maximum speeds elsewhere  closer  100   congested tracks shared with commuter  freight trains.

New generation  trains

This year, Amtrak plans  introduce   generation Avelia Liberty trains  replace  life-expired Acelas   NEC.

Capable  reaching 220  (although they’  limited  160    NEC),  trains will bring Alstom’ latest high-speed rail technology  North America.

The locomotives  each  – known  power cars –  close relatives   next generation TGV-M trains, scheduled  debut  France  2024.

Sitting between  power cars   passenger vehicles, which  Alstom’ Tiltronix technology   faster through curves  tilting their bodies, much like  MotoGP rider does. And ’  just travelers  will benefit.

“When Amtrak awarded  contract  Alstom  2015  2016,  company  around 200 employees  Hornell,” says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor   city  Hornell  New York state.

“That figure   nearer 900, with hiring continuing   fast pace. I calculate that there  been  total public/private investment  more than $269 million   city since 2016, including   hotel,  state--- hospital  housing developments.

“It   transformative economic development project that  basically unheard   rural America     happen here,   happen throughout  United States.”

Alstom  spent almost $600 million  building  US supply chain   high-speed trains – more than 80%   train  made   United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.

“High-speed rail  already here. Avelia Liberty  designed jointly with  European colleagues,   have what  need  ‘TGV-USA’,” adds Sherin.

“It’  proven tech from existing trains. We’ ready   when  infrastructure arrives.”

And those  lines could arrive sooner than  might think.

Incoming high-speed lines

In March, Brightline confirmed plans  begin construction   218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles,  Las Vegas, carving  path through  San Bernardino Mountains  across  desert, following  Interstate 15 corridor.

The 200  line will slash times  little more than  hour –  massive advantage over  four-hour average    five  seven hours   – when  opens  2027.

Mike Reininger, CEO  Brightline Holdings, says: “As  most shovel-ready high-speed rail project   United States,    step closer  leveling  playing field against transit  infrastructure projects around  world,    proud   using America’ most skilled workers   there.”

Brightline West expects  inject around $10 billion worth  benefits into  region’ economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs,  well  1,000 permanent jobs  maintenance, operations  customer service  Southern California  Nevada.

It will also mark  return  passenger trains  Las Vegas after  30-year hiatus – Amtrak canceled  “Desert Wind” route  1997.

Brightline hopes  attract around 12 million   50 million - trips taken annually between Las Vegas  LA, 85%  which  taken    .

Another California project

Meanwhile, construction  progressing  another high-speed line through  San Joaquin Valley.

Set  open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will  from Merced  Bakersfield (171 miles)  speeds    220 .

Coupled with proposed upgrades  commuter rail lines  either , this project could eventually allow high-speed trains    350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles  San Francisco metropolitan areas  just  hours  40 minutes.

CHSR  been   table   back  1996,   implementation  been controversial.

Disagreements over  route, management issues, delays  land acquisition  construction, cost over-runs  inadequate funding  completing  entire system have plagued  project – despite  economic benefits  will deliver  well  reducing pollution  congestion. Around 10,000 people  already employed   project.

Costing $63 billion  $98 billion, depending   final extent   scheme, CHSR   connect    10 largest cities   state  provide  same capacity  4,200 miles   highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates    airport runways costing between $122 billion  $199 billion.

With California’ population expected  grow  more than 45 million  2050, high-speed rail offers  best value solution  keep  state from grinding   smoggy halt.

Corridors   greatest potential

Brightline West  CHSR offer templates   future expansion  high-speed rail  North America.

By focusing  pairs  cities  regions that   close   travel    apart   drivers, transportation planners  predict which corridors offer  greatest potential.

“It’ logical that  US hasn’  developed  nationwide high-speed network,” says Sherin. “For decades, traveling   wasn’  hardship,   highway congestion gets worse, ’ reached  stage where  should start looking more seriously   alternatives.

“The magic numbers  centers  population with around three million people that  200  500 miles apart, giving  trip time  less than three hours – preferably  hours.

“Where those conditions apply  Europe  Asia, high-speed rail reduces ’ share   market from 100%  near zero. The model would work just  well   USA   does globally.”

Pipe dream?

Sherin points   success   original generation  Acela trains  evidence  this.

“When  first generation Acela trains started running between New York City  Washington  2000, Amtrak attracted  many travelers that  airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between   cities,”  adds.

However, industry observer Vantuono  more pessimistic.

“A US high-speed rail network   pipe dream,”  says. “A lack  political support  federal financial support combined with  kind  fierce landowner opposition that CHSR  faced  California means that  challenges   high-speed projects  enormous.”

According   International Energy Agency (IEA), urban  high-speed rail hold “major promise  unlock substantial benefits”  reducing global transport emissions.

Despite  advent  cars  airplanes, rail   types  continued  evolve  thrive. Fatih Birol, IEA executive director

Dr. Fatih Birol,  IEA’ executive director, argues that rail transport  “often neglected”  public debates about future transport systems –  this  especially true  North America.

“Despite  advent  cars  airplanes, rail   types  continued  evolve  thrive,” adds Birol.

Globally, around three-quarters  rail passenger movements  made  electric-powered vehicles, putting  mode   unique position  take advantage   rise  renewable energy over  coming decades.

Here, ,  United States lags  behind  rest   world, with electrification almost unheard  away from  NEC.

Rail networks  South Korea, Japan, Europe, China  Russia  more than 60% electrified, according  IEA figures,  highest share  track electrification being South Korea  around 85%.

In North America,   other hand, less than 5%  rail routes  electrified.

The enormous size   United States   widely dispersed population mitigates against  creation   single, unified network   type being built  China  proposed  Europe.

Air travel  likely  remain  preferred option  transcontinental journeys that   more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).

But there  many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail,   combination   infrastructure  upgraded railroad tracks  tilting trains, could eventually provide  unbeatable alternative   travel  highways.

Audie Cornish 00:08:50 And when ' around Nashville   have political conversations, wherever  person falls   spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this  The South.

Ketch Secor 00:09:03 Yeah. And whether ' supposed   that  ,  know, I think '   state  considerable growth down south,   vestiges remain,  they' important  talk about  this regard, because    vestiges   culture,  ' largely considered like  rebel flag   past, just something that exists here. Deal with , '. When  fact,  have always   power  drop  rebel flag. There'  vestige that  been challenged effectively.

Audie Cornish 00:09:40 And effected change   ,   least raise  kind  societal stakes engaging  certain language.

Ketch Secor 00:09:48 Totally. And  I   change   culture  just like another step towards The South' evolution.

Audie Cornish 00:09:57 To  mind, country, Americana, these genres  closely align with their audiences. It' very much like -, like people  - talk about  culture  their ties   music,   music ties  quite literally  identity   people listening. And country feels very much  same . But   result,      like rules. You know, there'  couple lines  they people ' like   step  . Can  talk about  that plays   modern country?

Ketch Secor 00:10:30 Sure. Well, today' country singer might  come from The South   college educated. So that they'   already changed  stereotype   sings country music. You know, ' '  coal miners anymore. The coal miner' daughter like   love Loretta,  that'  '  number  right . So that part    changed  . But what hasn' changed  much   attitudes   audience.

Audie Cornish 00:10:59 Which   clear. The country music audience also  wealthier   decision makers   often managers, there' been sort  like    research into many people     audience,   audience probably looks  little different than people expect  well.

Ketch Secor 00:11:15 Well, I didn' know   into this,   I' excited that  , Audie, because,  know, country music really especially,   clarify, contemporary country music   radio   real safe space     talk about political divisiveness   talk about things   substance. But instead '  sort  reading  Pulp Fiction together. And ' '

Audie Cornish 00:11:42 Which   ' popular, right? I mean, during  pandemic, I heard  growth  listening   music  streaming maybe   15%. It  higher than  other genre.

Ketch Secor 00:11:52 It' love stories.

Audie Cornish 00:11:52 People welcome that safe space.

Ketch Secor 00:11:54 Travel story. It'  know, ' very much stories, intergenerational family tales. That'  kind  stuff that goes number    song about grandpa  what  good        could   little  more like , then  world would   better place. So this sort ,  know, hallmark kind  these ideals that  tossed around might   that realistic  today' reality ,  know, I worked I' part   global economy working  jobs. And,  know, I' hoping  kids  going      state tuition  whatever. And   country music really deals  nostalgia. And that nostalgia    important antidote     pain that   witness   click   mouse.

Audie Cornish 00:12:44 Right. So  does . Culture interact with that nostalgia, storytelling, because ' saying    that that' built into  music, .

Ketch Secor 00:12:55 Johnny Cash singing I Shot  Man  Reno  Watch Him Die. Hank Jr Singing about. Yeah, I' like  spit some beach   that dude'   shoot  with   45 because  country   survive. This      country music  retain authority   changing world. And guns--

Audie Cornish 00:13:16 But   hear    modern music? Are there? You ' have  pick   artist. But  people still talk about that?

Ketch Secor 00:13:24 No, Audie. And that'  thing. We ' talk about guns. If  , '  song about I took   hunting   first time. It' again, dealing   nostalgia. What '  saying  I'   AR-15   collection. But  reality  that many, many listeners . And  '  safe space where they   confronted   music   changing reality. Instead, they  allowed  , I taught  child  ,  know, I mean, when I      eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned   fire  weapon. I learned   clean  weapon. These things  important   ways that  culture    positive,   safe space  that '  talking about what  means  today' America. Instead, ' pretty much hanging  yesterday'.

Audie Cornish 00:14:15 So what   like  artists such  yourself  raise this issue?

Ketch Secor 00:14:24 People keep saying, thanks  being brave. And I' like. You know ' brave    that pulled  fire alarm,  know,   hallway under gunfire   town   school,   that   third grader. Now, that' brave. All I' doing  just I'  singer  I' going  sing about  stuff that' real. I'  writer,  I' going  tell what I .

Audie Cornish 00:14:52 I ' want  read  much into  zoom,  I. Are  getting emotional talking about that?

Ketch Secor 00:14:57 Oh, yeah. I mean, I' been I' been crying   weeks, ', like '... When this comes  your town  they bury  same    yours. And then  then, like, while  graves  still fresh,  news cycle moves   Stormy Daniels,  that'  reality. It' like, Good God, where   live? What    care about kids  ? It' just over. So this     saying '  over   '  over until those deaths, those three deaths  American children gunned down   third grade, until they mean something, that' when '  over.

Audie Cornish 00:15:51 More with Ketch Secor  just  moment.

Audie Cornish 00:15:57 You  demanding   kind  movement come    south. And that   part    people   cultural figures  well,  just politicians, people such  yourself. Why   think  could make  difference?

Ketch Secor 00:16:14 Well, I think that Nashville stands uniquely poised  lead  response   school shooting epidemic.

Audie Cornish 00:16:22 But    think that? Right? We just watched  Tennessee State House expel  members because they   protest related   policy. Expel,  censure,  reprimand. Try  kick them . So what what  your mind leads   think that?

Ketch Secor 00:16:41 Well, Nashville, despite  fact that  state legislature  what  , Nashville   very progressive city. And I'  saying that Tennessee  going  lead  . I' saying Nashville.

Audie Cornish 00:16:55 Yeah,  ' that  tough part? If   these states  '  just Tennessee, '  these blue cities, these little blue dots     ,    I mean very conservative, very -, -Second Amendment legislatures. This sounds like  uphill battle. What ' calling .

Ketch Secor 00:17:19 Yes.

Audie Cornish 00:17:19 And I know ' worth . I ' want  because   know ' worth . But I want I want  understand   think country musicians     uniquely positioned  have this conversation.

Ketch Secor 00:17:32 Well,  I want  I appreciate  challenging this Audie. First thing I want    that changing segregation   uphill battle  Tennessee. And  when Nashville   early 1960s,   late 1950s said  first foot forward, this   proving ground, other parts   South were  unsafe. But people gathered  Nashville,  city  colleges,  city  progressive thought   South  engage  nonviolent civil disobedience. This  where John Lewis came. This  where  Freedom Riders first stop .

Audie Cornish 00:18:09 Their trainings, right, with James Lawson   Vanderbilt.

Ketch Secor 00:18:12 All  that training  Fisk  Vanderbilt happened right here  Nashville, Tennessee. That shows  ability     community  exist outside   state. Now, just like  that time,  state legislator said, what   talking about? That'  going  happen   state. We cast  deciding vote   women' suffrage. I mean, Tennessee  been  bellwether place  these  other instances  great significance. This   third. This   part   death knell    South, which  going  have  change. You know, 50 years from  I think ' going   looking back  these couple  years   deciding time   assault weapons    United States.

Audie Cornish 00:18:59 Again, I want  bring    question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones  given what  know about  music, number , have been socially punished  activism  what  call Music Row,  music radio,  country music radio  particular, which still   very kind  strong grip    programmers ,  even recent history. Right. When  think about  Dixie Chicks, ., their whole story   story  being ostracized  their activism.

Ketch Secor 00:19:34 You know,    like , I'  beholden   many people  ,  I'   mainstream. I'    Jumbotron,  know, I'    awards show with    performers   year.

Audie Cornish 00:19:49 Do  need those people   movement ' talking about?

Ketch Secor 00:19:53 They have  really  reach   power  accelerate  inevitable movement  change this   kids. And I' asking them through this piece  also face  face   community, through conversations  text. You know, I' reached    many singers   past  weeks.

Audie Cornish 00:20:18 And what kind  text  send.

Ketch Secor 00:20:20 Hey, I' just reaching     Nashville music community   wake   shooting  sharing this story that I wrote that came  today  The Times. If    , please take  look.

Audie Cornish 00:20:32 What' been  most positive response? What' been  most frustrating ?

Ketch Secor 00:20:37 The most frustrating   silence. I      piece that I think silence  complicity. I went into  studio  I  I recorded   song   subject. Since  shooting, which  only  weeks  there have been  many ways   engaged with this terrible story,  ' powerful solution.

Audie Cornish 00:21:00 I mean,  reason  I' asking  because your   said something pretty specific, right? That there  artists   tired  being   kind  mercy   whims  fearmongers,  said,  that they' ready  speak   impressionable audience. And because other genres, like  mentioned   earlier  , they  wade into societal issues. They   confrontational about politics. It'  like there '  model  there. So I guess what would  take,   think,  people  your industry? To start   something similar, which  which ,  effect, what ' calling .

Ketch Secor 00:21:39 It  beginning  ', I think,   infancy,  ' already started.

Ketch Secor 00:21:45 Mm .

Audie Cornish 00:21:45 And  ' about fanning  flames  building   bonfire   what' already crackling kindling. For example, '   benefit concert here  Nashville that supports Covenant School. And when  look    roster, '   marquee, '   usual Americana folks  always ,  know,  stand with kids,  stand  against  violence. Instead, ' number  chart toppers. They  there. They have  their  into  ring.

Audie Cornish 00:22:19 But   because '   going    safe space from politics? If '  moment   memorial,  that what makes  okay    artist   there? Right. Because nobody' going       should have  control.

Ketch Secor 00:22:34 There' nothing   here because   have started   very baseline where music coming   Nashville   radio says nothing about violence against children   schools  about  need  rethink  types  weaponry that  associated with  Second Amendment. Kelsea Ballerini talked about    award show. These   kinds  things that when somebody takes  step   movement  quickly follow , then  next step '  hard  make. And what I' asking   that next step. You know, I' gotten    feedback from  audience. And like I      piece,  know, I   NRA sticker   back    trucks blaring   tunes. So,  know,  '    road with Hank Jr. this summer. So, I mean, I' I' used  playing   audience that   country folk. But I love  country folk audience. And I  I want   able   real with them. I  move freely  both   spaces that    silos   country. Like, I might   work   silo  come home   other . And I' good with that because I love those people.

Audie Cornish 00:23:55 What  your message  those artists   just still very reluctant?

Ketch Secor 00:24:00 Country music   great destiny  these times  swing  past  fences that have corralled    tightly. That I believe  this genre. And I believe that    power  carry that truth. You know, ' very much rooted   gospel tradition    lamentation,  calling    great spirits. Help , Lord. We' just your children. We ' know shit. We' ' dying down here. Help!

Audie Cornish 00:24:33 Can  talk about  song that ' written   this moment?

Ketch Secor 00:24:38 New material? You know, generally, just like I'   songwriting mood here, I'    moment  time with    different opportunities   writer  engage  this, whether ',  know, writing  right caption   photograph  Instagram  writing    piece  The New York Times  being  this podcast with , Audie. There'  many ways  choose  words right     have them  resonant   pain that ' feeling  Nashville, Tennessee  around  country because   just  tired, parents, that  kids   safe  their schools. What that means     songwriter  that I also have  chance  write  music about this     money where  mouth . So I    song that' coming  called Louder Than Guns. That' yeah, I just recorded   days .

Audie Cornish 00:25:33 Give   sense   tune  lyrics.

Ketch Secor 00:25:37 Well, gosh, I feel like I shouldn' even brought   because ' ...anytime     know, people  cagey about their  stuff!

Audie Cornish 00:25:46 Oh, I !

Editor’ Note: This   updated version   story that originally   April 14, 2023.

New York CNN —

It’ April 18,  official deadline  file your federal  state income  returns  2022. (It  also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day  those  celebrate.)

Whether  have already filed your  return  still need ,  good news  this  filing season  gone much more smoothly than  past three, which were hurt   pandemic.

“This   first  season since 2019 where  IRS   nation were  normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said   call with reporters.

For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks   infusion  some  funding after years  budget cuts, IRS employees have been able  answer 87%  calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And  wait times  those phone calls dropped  just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.

The agency also added  roster   online tools  filers,  added.

Still haven’ filed?

Those online tools   especially helpful today    scrambling   your return  before midnight. Or,  ’ come   realization that  need  file   extension. Either , here  some  things  know:

Not everyone   file  April 18: If  live   federally declared disaster area, have  business there —  have relevant  documents stored  businesses  that area — ’ likely  IRS  already extended  filing  payment deadlines  . Here  where   find  specific extension dates  each disaster area.

Thanks  many rounds  extreme weather  recent months,  instance,  filers  most  California — which accounts  10%  15%   federal filers — have already been granted  extension until Oct. 16  file   , according   IRS spokesperson.

If ’   armed forces   currently  were recently stationed   combat zone,  filing  payment deadlines  your 2022 taxes  most likely extended  180 days. But your specific extended filing  payment deadlines will depend     leave ( left)  combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly,   made little   money last year (typically less than $12,950  single filers  $25,900  married couples),     required  file  return. But   want  anyway   think   eligible   refund thanks ,  instance, refundable  credits such   Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool  gauge whether   required  file this year.) You also  likely eligible   IRS Free File (intended  those with adjusted gross income  $73,000  less)   ’ cost   submit  return.

Your paycheck    your only source  income: If    full-time    think that   only income  made  have  report. But that’  necessarily .

Other potentially taxable  reportable income sources include:

Interest  your savings

Investment income (.., dividends  capital gains)

Pay  part-time  seasonal work,   side hustle

Unemployment income

Social Security benefits  distribution from  retirement account

Tips

Gambling winnings

Income from  rental property  

Organize your  documents: By   should have received every  document that third parties  required  send  (your employer, bank, brokerage, .).

If  ’ recall receiving  hard copy    form   mail, check your email  your online accounts —  document  have been sent   electronically.

Here  some    forms   have received:

The 1099-K  required   made more than $20,000  over 200 transactions during  year. (Next year  reporting threshold drops  $600.) But even   didn’   1099-K  still must report   income that  made over third-party platforms  2022.

“Be aware that there’  form  some taxable income, like proceeds from renting  your vacation property, meaning ’ responsible  reporting   your ,” according   Illinois CPA Society.

One very last-minute   reduce your 2022  bill: If ’ eligible  make  -deductible contribution   IRA  haven’ done   last year,  have until April 18  contribute   $6,000 ($7,000  ’ 50  older). That will reduce your  bill  augment your retirement savings.

Proofread your return before submitting : Do this whether ’ using  software  working with  professional  preparer.

Little mistakes  oversights delay  processing  your return (  issuance  your refund  ’ owed ). You want  avoid things like having  typo  your name, birth date, Social Security number  direct deposit number; choosing  wrong filing status (.., married  single); making  simple math error;  leaving  required field blank.

What     ’ file  April 18: If ’  able  file  time, fill  Form 4868 electronically   paper  send    later than today. You will  granted  automatic -month extension  file.

Note, however, that  extension  file    extension  . You will  charged interest (currently running  7%)   penalty   amount  still   2022  haven’ paid  April 18.

So   suspect  still   — perhaps   some income outside  your   which  wasn’ withheld      capital gain last year — approximate  much more    send that money   IRS     today.

You  choose     mail, attaching  check  your extension request form. Make sure your envelope  postmarked  later than April 18.

Or  more efficient route   what   electronically  IRS., said CPA Damien Martin,   partner  EY. If   that,  IRS notes  will  have  file  Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process  extension  time  file,”  agency notes   instructions.

If    electronically  directly from your bank account, which  free, select “extension”  then “ year 2022” when given  option.

You  also   credit  debit card,   will  charged  processing . Doing , though,  become much more costly than just     charge your  payment  ’  your credit card bill   full every month, since  likely   high interest rate  outstanding balances.

If  ’  what    full,  IRS does have some payment plan options. But  might  smart  first consult with  certified public accountant    preparer    enrolled agent  make sure   making  best choice  your circumstance.

If  still  income taxes  your state, remember that   need   through  similar exercise  filing   extension  making  payment  your state’ revenue department, Martin said.

Use this interactive  assistant  basic questions   have: The IRS provides  “interactive  assistant” that  help  answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining  your individual circumstance  income, deductions, credits  other technical questions.

Already filed?

If ’ already filed your return, ’ probably glad  have    rear view mirror. But   still have   questions about what’ ahead.

What about  refund? If     refund,  IRS typically sends  within 21 days  receiving your return. When yours does arrive,    smaller than last year, even  your financial life didn’ change much. That’ because  number  Covid-related  breaks expired.

So ,  average refund paid  $2,878   week ending April 7, down from $3,175   same point  last year’ filing season.

Will I  audited?: The reasons  methods  auditing  taxpayer  vary —  many audits result  “ change,” meaning  ’   owing anything more   IRS. But  thing  common   vast majority  US  filers: Audit rates  exceedingly .

For filers reporting incomes between $50,000  $200,000, only 0.1%  them were audited  2020, according   latest data from  IRS. Even  very high income filers, audit rates were quite : Just 0.4%  those reporting income  between $1 million  $5 million; 0.7%  those with income between $5 million  $10 million;  2.4%  returns with income over $10 million.

Looking ahead,  IRS commissioner noted   press call that  agency will  using money from  Inflation Reduction Act  bolster  compliance efforts  focus more  auditing high-income individuals — defined  making $400,000  more. As  filers with income below that level,  said    anticipate  change   likelihood they would  audited.

CNN —

It’  surprising fact that’ often overlooked   immigration debate.

Undocumented immigrants  billions  dollars  federal taxes annually, between  returns filed  taxes deducted from paychecks, experts estimate.

Here’  look   –   – this  happening.

Why some undocumented immigrants choose   taxes

The National Immigration Law Center breaks down  number  reasons  undocumented immigrants  taxes, including:

• It shows they’ complying with federal  laws.

• It  help them demonstrate “good moral character”  they later have  opportunity  legalize their immigration status.

• Tax return records could  used  document work history  presence   US, steps that  help them  eligible  legal immigration status   future  lawmakers pass immigration reform.

How some  taxes despite  having Social Security numbers

Critics  illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants   taxes  able    because they’ using stolen Social Security numbers. But millions  federal  dollars  paid every year  people  ’ have Social Security numbers  .

Instead, they file using what’ known   Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).

The Bipartisan Policy Center,  Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe  vast majority   returns filed with ITINs today  filed  undocumented immigrants.”

Some noncitizens  legally immigrated   United States also  taxes using this method.

In 2019, according   IRS, more than 2.5 million  returns were filed using ITINs, accounting  nearly $6 billion  taxes.

In addition   return filings, officials estimate that undocumented immigrants also contribute billions  Social Security annually through payroll  deductions. In 2010,  example,  Social Security Administration estimated that payments from unauthorized workers accounted  about $12 billion   revenue  Social Security.

Immigrant rights advocates  speaking   social media

In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts  Facebook, Twitter  TikTok during  season have drawn attention   issue.

“Undocumented immigrants  billions  taxes  fund programs they ’ access,”  National immigration Law Center wrote   series  recent social media posts.

In 2017, Belén Sisa’ post about  experience paying taxes went viral.

“Wanna tell  again  I should  deported, contribute nothing  only leech  this country while  1% wealthiest people  this country steal from  everyday?” wrote Sisa,    college student  Arizona   time.

The beneficiary   Deferred Action  Childhood Arrivals program later told CNN  felt   important  speak .

“I wanted  show people that ’ here,  that  come from  over  world,  that  contribute more than people think that  ,”  said.

Jose Antonio Vargas,  Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist ’ turned  struggles   undocumented immigrant into  platform  advocacy, took  break from finalizing  taxes  2019  share  experience  Twitter.

“Yes,”  wrote, “undocumented immigrants  helping fund  very systems that detain  deport .”

Tuesday  Tax Day  America,    most stressful days   year, when many taxpayers will finally  their procrastination, file their federal returns,  hope   refund from  IRS. But  many   nation’ wealthiest, ’ just another Tuesday.

Abigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro  Rod Coplin

Morris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz

Tax Day ’ just  filing deadline — ’ also  annual reminder that  ultra-rich exist   entirely separate world when  comes  taxes. For ,  loopholes  bigger   rates  sometimes lower. Meanwhile,  rich keep getting richer, with  wealth  billionaires  particular growing  more than $1.5 trillion over  last  years.

This status   unfair,  even more importantly, ’ unsustainable. Such high levels  inequality  pushing  economy   democracy  their breaking points. That’   should examine      country   long-term stability  prosperity. And  should start  ensuring that  ultra-rich  more  what they   country that made their success possible.

There  three changes    code that would help   just that:

Tax  types  income  same  high earners

Right ,  US  system values money over sweat. If  work hard  your money instead  earning  passively, ’ essentially penalized  . People  earn  salary  significantly higher  rates  their income than wealthy investors  passively earn capital gains income.

Inheriting money   even better deal. Thanks  former president Donald Trump’ 2017  ,  first $12.92 million ( $25.84 million   married couple)  completely exempt from  estate ,   stepped- basis loophole allows wealthy families  permanently erase millions  capital gains taxes  resetting  market value  those assets  their value   time   original owner’ death. With this,  becomes relatively simple   rich  inherit tens, even hundreds  millions  dollars,   almost nothing  taxes. Someone working  that money,   other hand, would  over  third    federal income taxes.

Why   have   code that says working people should  taxed more than wealthy investors  those   rich just  virtue  being born into  right family? At     , money  money, whether  worked    whether  inherited . As  heiress   investor,  should   paying lower  rates than people  earn their money from working.

It’ time    code  treat  income equally  taxing  capital gains over $1 million   same rates  ordinary income,  replacing  loophole-ridden estate  with  simpler inheritance  that treats inherited wealth  income.

Tax wealth  unrealized capital gains

We ’ just focus  income, however, because many   richest Americans earn basically  taxable income   kind   typical year. Capital gains  only taxed when assets  sold,  instead  selling them,  ultra-rich  their assets  collateral  borrow vast sums  money  extremely  interest rates  live ,  then declare little  even negative “income”  their  forms. This “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy   major reason billionaires paid  lower effective  rate over recent years than working-class families.

By rethinking what  taxable,    access   trillions  dollars  billionaire wealth that  untouchable under  current  structure. That’  President Biden  proposed  Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would   unrealized capital gains   wealthiest households   others have proposed wealth taxes  billionaires.

Tax  highest earners more

Finally,    most straightforward changes needed   simply   extremely rich more than  merely rich. Our income  caps     rate  37%   income over $578,125 ( $693,750  married couples). No matter  much more someone makes, they’ never  more than 37%  federal income taxes.

While someone earning $600,000  certainly making enough  live  very comfortable life, they’   different world than someone making $600 million  year. In order  reflect  real differences between  rich   ultra-rich,  need  return    rates   through  most prosperous decades   20th century   significantly more  brackets. They should reach   90%  people making more than $100 million  year.

These three changes certainly ’    country’ problems  their ,  they would   long   stopping  steady flow   country’ wealth toward  smaller  smaller group  people,  change that would make both  democracy   economy more stable. The  code    powerful tool  both social  economic change. We just need    more effectively.

China’ economy     solid start  2023,  consumers went   spending spree after three years  strict pandemic restrictions ended.

Gross domestic product grew  4.5%   first quarter from  year , according   National Bureau  Statistics  Tuesday. That beat  estimate  4% growth from  Reuters poll  economists.

But private investment barely budged  youth unemployment surged   second highest level  record, indicating  country’ private sector employers  still wary about longer term prospects.

Consumption posted  strongest rebound. Retail sales jumped 10.6%  March from  year earlier,  highest level  growth since June 2021. In  January  March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted   surge  revenue from  catering service industry.

“The combination   steady uptick  consumer confidence  well   still-incomplete release  pent- demand suggest   that  consumer- recovery still  room  ,” said Louise Loo, China lead economist  Oxford Economics.

After mass street protests gripped  country  local governments    cash   huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped  zero-Covid policy  December. Following  brief period  disruption    Covid surge,  economy  started showing signs  recovery.

Last month,  official gauge  -manufacturing activity jumped   highest level  more than  decade, suggesting  country’ crucial services sector  benefiting from  resurgence  consumer spending after    pandemic restrictions.

As  economic recovery gains traction, investment banks  international organizations have upgraded China’ growth forecasts  this year. In  World Economic Outlook released last week,  International Monetary Fund said China  “rebounding strongly” following  reopening   economy. The country’ GDP will grow 5.2% this year  5.1%  2024,  predicted.

Private business retreat

However, some analysts believe  strong growth reported   first quarter   product  “backloading”  economic activity from  fourth quarter  2022, which  weighed down  pandemic restrictions  then  chaotic reopening.

If adjustments  made  account   impact  delayed economic activity, GDP growth   first quarter could have been just 2.6%,  said.

Some  data released  Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment  extremely weak.

Fixed asset investment   private sector increased  mere 0.6% from January  March, indicating  lack  confidence among entrepreneurs. (State- investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That’ even worse than  0.8% growth recorded   January--February period.

The Chinese government  resorted  surprising measures  restore confidence among private entrepreneurs,   campaign  inspired more nervousness than optimism.

The -important property industry  also mired   deep downturn. Investment  property declined 5.8%   first quarter. Property sales  floor area decreased  1.8%.

“The domestic economy  recovering well,   constraints  insufficient demand  still obvious,” said Fu Linghui,  spokesman   NBS,   news conference  Beijing  Tuesday. “Prices  industrial products  still falling,  enterprises  facing many difficulties  their profitability.”

Youth unemployment surges

Unemployment continued  surge among  youth.

The jobless rate  16-  24-year-olds  19.6%  March,    third straight month. It   second highest  record, only behind  19.9% level reached  July 2022.

The high jobless rate among  youth suggests “slack   economy,” Yeung said.

“By June, there will    batch  graduates looking  jobs. The jobless condition could worsen further  China’ economic momentum falters,”  added.

China’ education ministry  previously estimated that  record 11.6 million college graduates will  looking  jobs this year.

At last month’ meeting   National People’ Congress,  country’ rubber-stamp parliament,  government   cautious growth plan  this year, with  GDP target  around 5%    creation target  12 million.

That’ because I took mifepristone years  during  miscarriage,   saved  life.

When I  prescribed mifepristone,     taken center stage  America’ abortion wars. I   have  make  rushed road trip across state lines    medicine, unlike many women  need  drug  live     many states that have restricted access  medication abortion  passed near-total bans  abortion.

I   forced     secret meet- with  stranger  order    medicine   black market,  several women I spoke  recently said they planned  . Nor  I have  order mifepristone online  find myself navigating  many scammers taking advantage   current patchwork  state abortion laws   US.

Mifepristone     drugs used   medication abortion   other, misoprostol,   subject   ruling   Texas judge. The  drugs   administered  someone having  miscarriage, allowing them  terminate  pregnancy when  fetus   viable.

It happened some years : After experiencing more than    hemorrhaging during  first trimester   pregnancy, I visited  -,  explained after examining  that  blood pressure  dropping rapidly   heavy bleeding I  experiencing   unmistakable sign   miscarriage.

For many women, being prescribed mifepristone  part  their routine medical care. Not    case: As  doctor explained, I  facing  dire medical emergency. I  grateful   medication that saved  life.

My miscarriage took   surprise. I  loved being pregnant  first time around, about  decade earlier. And   healthy woman, I   reason  fear when I became pregnant again. By  time I  administered mifepristone, I  losing  life that I  already begun  love. And like many other women, despite  level  education  economic status, I could  outrun  statistics that  Black women  higher risk.

Up    four known pregnancies will    miscarriage. And  Black women,  numbers  alarmingly higher. According   analysis  4.6 million pregnancies  seven countries,  risk   miscarriage  Black women  43% higher than  White women.

In  Black community, women have traditionally been taught  bear their burdens silently — keep your business  yourself — even after something  devastating  pregnancy loss. We  conditioned    I  back then,  keep  moving     outrun  long list  statistics that tell   lives   danger from every direction, whether   from health care risks  societal injustices  other stressors.

During  miscarriage, I   woman   afraid, hemorrhaging   excruciating pain,  desperate need  safe, emergency medical care. Thanks   administration  mifepristone, I  allowed dignity during  miscarriage. It’ what every woman deserves — whether   facing  potentially life-threatening miscarriage  seeking  abortion.

I learned from  experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access  whatever medicines  counseling  need  help  heal  that includes mifepristone. What  ’ need    criminalized  politicians  punitive reproductive laws that have long been   step with public opinion. Despite  continuing political attacks  women’ reproductive rights, more than 61%  US adults  abortion should  legal    most cases, according  Pew Research Center.

After  US Justice Department asked  Supreme Court  intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued  temporary order  preserve  status , ensuring access   drug while giving  justices more time  study  issue.

I  hoping  justices   politics aside  focus   science surrounding  safety  mifepristone,  drug that, thankfully, I  access  when  life   danger. Mifepristone,  synthetic steroid,  even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin  Viagra.

Following  science demands that, regardless  where  stand   issue  abortion, consideration must  made  cases like mine   millions  other women   years have safely used this medication  complications surrounding miscarriages.

We   know   legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across  nation –  blue   states alike –  watching. Punitive laws like   signed last week  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek  criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they  stripping   rights that  take  granted – ’ unlikely they will  prohibited    from making health care decisions about their  bodies.

It must . And I’ betting that whether   with  voice   votes, women will have  last word.

CNN —

When Ralph Nader   president  2000,  offered  simple rationale    that would ultimately help “spoil”  election   Democratic ticket I  privileged    with Al Gore. In Nader’ view,   parties were ideologically indistinguishable.

That argument  baseless. There were significant differences  policy between  George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket — which ended  victorious,  part thanks  Nader —  ours. For Nader, this wasn’ really about  “-party duopoly,”   coined . This  about  desire  push Gore   Democratic Party   left.

Today,  course,    reasonably argue that   parties aren’ ideologically distinct. The core problem  Washington, DC,  that they’  divided   much done.

Though  majority  Americans long    when Republicans  Democrats worked together  find bipartisan solutions   problems, many members  Congress refuse  work together  immigration,  debt ceiling  other issues critical   nation, even when bipartisanship     restore  common prosperity  security. Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling  House  Democrats  Senate, bipartisanship   only   pass  legislation.

While undoing  divisions plaguing  political system will   simple, there   step that   taken —   begins with giving voters  real alternative   2024 presidential election.

Most often, when Americans cast their votes  president  vice president, their ballot  only  viable tickets:  nominated   Democratic Party   other   Republican Party. But what would happen  they   third viable option?

The process  adding that third viable option   only arduous  time-consuming,   varies from state  state    District  Columbia.

Today, No Labels,  nonprofit organization that I -chair,  laying  groundwork  such  campaign  2024. Since early 2022,  team  been diligently working across  country  obtain ballot access   potential No Labels ticket, typically  collecting  certain number  petition signatures from voters  each state.

If   successful,  unity ticket — comprised   Democrat   Republican — could  presented  voters right next   Republican  Democratic nominees.

We think  this   insurance policy   country —  option   deployed ,  only , both    major party nominees fail  offer voters  choice  candidates they’ like  vote        partisan divisiveness that  dominates   nation’ capital. We will  consistently monitoring  sentiment  Americans through   research  polling,  well  public polling,  make that determination.

In this  several other ways, No Labels’ effort could   more different from  “spoiler” campaign that Nader attempted  decades .

First,  No Labels were  lend  ballot lines   presidential ticket,  presidential candidate would   Democrat   vice presidential candidate would   Republican,  vice versa. As such,  would appeal  some voters  might otherwise have voted   Democratic ticket,  other voters  might otherwise have voted   Republican ticket. And  would appeal  still other voters  would  have voted  either.

These nominees would  selected   diverse  distinguished group  citizens serving   committee —  would  ratified  delegates  would gather   No Labels National Convention planned  April 2024. This convention will occur about  weeks after  March 5th “Super Tuesday” primaries,   which historically  clarified   major party nominees will .

Second, No Labels’ 2024 effort   designed  push  Democratic nominees   left  Republican candidates   right. Rather, ’ intended  force   both parties  appeal  America’ growing commonsense majority. If they ’,  ballot line will create  opening   unity ticket that will.

According  recent polling  CNN,  number  individuals  identify  independent    rise,  comprising 41%   electorate — compared  only 28%  described themselves  Democrats  31%  described themselves  Republicans. These numbers  more evidence that there could   potential path  victory   independent ticket  2024.

But  there doesn’ appear   such  path   months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead   work  have done over  last decade  elect  organize members   House  Senate  have demonstrated  courage  reach across  aisle — including members   bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus.

It seems  Biden administration already   beginning  recognize  imperative  appealing   commonsense majority. President Joe Biden recently signed into   Republican measure  strike down  Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties  those  commit violent crimes,   announced more stringent border control policies.

Our hope  that  Republicans jockeying  their party’ nomination will similarly   need  reach  beyond their base instead  appealing  divisive policies  politics.

In  , No Labels hopes   have  offer  ballot line   independent unity ticket. We want  parties  come  their senses. But judging from  angry  apocalyptic reactions  strategists  both parties   thought  No Labels’ insurance policy,   clear that party leaders  know that there could   political cost  ignoring  commonsense majority. And that’  reason  hope   better future   government   country.

On Monday,  GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired  Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan —    hold  field hearing  New York City called “Victims  Violent Crime  Manhattan.” A statement bills  hearing   examination  ,  Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’ policies have “   increase  violent crime   dangerous community  New York City residents.”

Dean Obeidallah CNN

In response, Bragg’ office slammed Jordan’ hearing  “ political stunt” while noting that data released   New York Police Department shows crime  down  Manhattan with respect  murders, burglaries, robberies  more through April 2, compared with  same period last year.

In reality, this Jordan- hearing ’ about stopping crime  about defending Trump —   recently charged   Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded  guilty   criminal charges stemming from  investigation into  hush-money payment   adult film actress. The former president also  facing criminal probes  other jurisdictions over efforts  overturn  2020 election   handling  classified documents  Mar--Lago.

Bragg sued Jordan   committee last week  federal court, accusing  Judiciary Committee chairman   “transparent campaign  intimidate  attack”  office   investigation  prosecution  Trump  making demands  confidential documents  testimony.

While Jordan   committee appear focused  discrediting  investigation into Trump,  aren’ they looking into  recent bombshell reports  ProPublica that raised  flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After ,  House Judiciary Committee’ website explains that   jurisdiction over “matters relating   administration  justice  federal courts” –  which  revelations concerning Thomas  perfectly.

First,  learned  early April that Crow  provided Thomas   wife, Ginni,  decades with luxurious vacations including   donor’ yacht  private   faraway places such  Indonesia  New Zealand. That information  never revealed   public. (In  rare public statement, Thomas responded   advised   time that    have  report  trips. The justice said  guidelines  reporting personal hospitality have changed recently. “And,  ,  course,  intent  follow this guidance   future,”  said.)

Then  Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed  disclose  2014 real estate deal involving  sale  three properties    family owned  Savannah, Georgia,  that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One  Crow’ companies made  purchases  $133,363, according  ProPublica. A federal disclosure  passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices  other officials  make public  details  most real estate sales over $1,000.

As ProPublica detailed,  federal disclosure form Thomas filed  that year included  space  report  identity   buyer   private transaction,  Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics  experts told ProPublica that Thomas’ failure  report  appears    violation   . (Thomas   respond  questions from ProPublica   report; CNN reached    Supreme Court  Thomas  comment.)

The House Judiciary Committee  long addressed issues such  those surrounding Thomas. In fact,  committee  where investigations   impeachment  federal judges often commence.

One recent example came  2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom  committee investigated  recommended  impeachment.

The committee’ Task Force  Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements  representations under penalty  perjury, engaged   corrupt kickback scheme, solicited  accepted unlawful gifts,  intentionally misled  Senate during  confirmation proceedings.” The Senate later found Porteous guilty  four articles  impeachment  removed  from  bench.

Yet  Judiciary Committee  neither released statements  tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead,  Twitter feed  filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN ’ cover Monday’ New York field hearing. Worse,  committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Miller’ tweet defending Thomas  being attacked “because      deep faith,  loves  country  believes   Constitution.”

Jordan’    committee  assist Trump should surprise  . The House January 6 committee’ report called  Ohio Republican “ significant player  President Trump’ efforts”  overturn  election. The report detailed  lawmaker’ efforts  assist Trump including  “January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan   conference call  which , President Trump,  other Members  Congress discussed strategies  delaying  January 6th joint session.” As  result,  January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan  testify —   refused  cooperate.

In contrast with  House panel,  Senate Judiciary Committee — headed  Democrats — announced   wake   reporting  Thomas that  plans  hold  hearing “  need  restore confidence   Supreme Court’ ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse  Rhode Island  Rep. Hank Johnson  Georgia sent  letter Friday calling   referral  Thomas   US attorney general over “potential violations   Ethics  Government Act 1978.”

The House Judiciary Committee’ website notes, “The Committee   Judiciary  been called  lawyer   House  Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs   updated  state that  Committee   Judiciary   “ lawyer  Donald J. Trump.” And  worst part  that  taxpayers   ones paying  Jordan’ work  Trump’ behalf.

Four years , almost   ,  people  Sudan were celebrating  revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar -Bashir. Now  East African country faces  possibility   complete collapse similar   chaos   today  Yemen  Libya.

On Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other   capital  Khartoum. The  sides battled  control   nation’ airports, bases  military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into  streets  across  country.

Some 45 million Sudanese effectively  held hostage   unable  venture   their homes  fear  being killed   crossfire. At least 180 people have perished   fighting, including three World Food Programme humanitarian workers.

The conflict pits  bitter rivals  their powerful armed forces against each other. On  side   Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF),   Gen. Abdel Fattah -Burhan. On  other side   Rapid Support Forces (RSF),  paramilitary group   Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known  Hemeti.

There   good side  this conflict. Both have been accused   long litany  human rights violations.

How  Sudan  from casting  despotic rule  creating  fledgling democracy   years   teetering   brink  state collapse?

Revolution lost

On April 11, 2019, Sudan’ longtime dictator, Bashir,  overthrown. The cause  Bashir’ removal  months  protests   Sudan’ unions, which spurred  military coup from  SAF  RSF. Both Burhan  Hemeti joined forces  remove their former boss.

It   moment  promise because there  hope  democracy. I remember walking around  “-” —  giant carnival  freedom   middle  Khartoum that protesters  blocked   demand change. It  electric.

But social movements such   Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) —  union behind  protest — often struggle  translate  momentum  their demonstrations into real political power.

The reason  this ,  part, structural. Social movements such   SPA  often based  grassroots activism. A dictator  arrest    leaders   organization    entire country.

However, once  dictator  overthrown, these kinds  social movements often struggle  build  leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan’ protesters were unable  translate mobilization into political power.

Civilian leaders entered into  negotiation with  military over  future   country shortly after Bashir fell  April 2019. The  sides were  evenly matched. Because  these leadership challenges,  -democracy forces struggled  bargain with  disciplined military.

Any momentum that -democracy advocates  during  negotiations  stamped   June 2019 when RSF soldiers violently dispersed  -. More than 100 people were killed.

After  June massacre   leadership challenges,  transitional constitution  signed  August 2019 that gave  SAF  RSF most   power  Sudan. Burhan   head  state,  Hemeti  placed   elevated political position. Elections were promised  2022,   believed they would actually happen.

A legacy  autocracy

The transitional period began  August 2019,  I interviewed Abdalla Hamdok,  civilian prime minister, several times   book that I -wrote  Sudan’ revolution. The  that  constitution  written meant that Hamdok  limited power   prime minister. Burhan   head  state  wanted  preserve  powers   SAF.

Hamdok often told  that revolutions come  cycles. The 2019 removal  Bashir   high point  revolution,       making  many reforms  possible before   tide  counterrevolution swept  away.

Hamdok found that  legacy  30 years  dictatorship meant that Sudan’ political  economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan  Hemeti blocked   reforms that Hamdok wanted  make.

Outside Khartoum violence grew. Parts  Sudan such  Darfur    round  conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated  RSF troops. More than 430,000 people were displaced   conflict  Sudan, mostly  Darfur.

Soldiers   hide  atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking  with  soldier aligned with  RSF   house  Darfur   explained    recently participated   burning down   village from another ethnic group.

The soldier reasoned that  member   tribe  been killed   altercation,   RSF-aligned forces took revenge  torching  village that  been home  30,000 people. At least 163 people died.

Tensions between  SAF  RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti   RSF forces  upstart usurpers from Darfur  were undisciplined. Hemeti   other hand believed that   time  Darfur  lead Sudan.

Hamdok    cusp  beginning  turn  economy around when Burhan   SAF intervened. As  wrote   book “Sudan’ Unfinished Democracy,”  potential success   civilian government   much  Burhan. In October 2021, Hamdok  removed   military coup.

International delusion

After  October 2021 coup,  United States  United Nations pushed  worse version   transitional constitution  Sudan. They argued that    best   bring democracy.

The idea   restart  transitional period,  I  many others argued   shortsighted  wouldn’ work. Returning   government   Burhan  clearly  going  usher  democracy. If  plan ended   coup  first time,  would  work  second time?

Some activists stopped partnering with  US  came    UN mission   roadblock  democracy because  these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with  best American  foreign diplomats,  also understood  international policy  Sudan wouldn’ work. They   flaws  felt powerless  dissent  were forced  carry  decisions made many levels above them.

What preceded this weekend’ outbreak  clashes   controversial part   international policy that tried  unify  SAF  RSF. The idea   make  single army,  neither Hemeti  Burhan wanted  give   power they  amassed.

The plan  unify  military hadn’ worked  similar contexts. It   repeat   2013  2016 unification processes that took place  South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead,  tenuous relationship between Burhan  Hemeti boiled over    pressure.

What’ next?

It   easy  look   recent history  “revolutions”  countries such  Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt  Sudan  conclude that they eventually backfire. I ’ agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that  nation’ political fortune   active battle.

Of  many dark gifts Showtime’ eerie  series “Yellowjackets” serves   ,  juiciest this season     music.

The show – which bounces between  troupe  teen soccer players trapped   1990s Canadian wilderness after  plane crash   survivors’ corresponding adult selves   present  – embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from  tail   last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt  much more.

In Sunday’ episode  “Yellowjackets,” -rock queen Alanis Morissette will debut  version   show’ theme song, “No Return,”   already released    single.

One   most unexpected  successful uses  throwback music came   first episode  Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole’ Jeff   moment  himself    after  intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) – during which  rocks  hard  Papa Roach’ “Last Resort” (sure,  track actually came   2000,  that doesn’ take away from  retro vibe).

In  interview with CNN,  show’ music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that  Papa Roach song selection  scripted,  “served   perfect physical outlet  Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone   garage.”

Other standout moments   script, however,  hers  interpret,  Felder relishes  opportunity  match those moments with  right songs from  period.

“I -immerse myself into  show’   spirit   times  I start  build  playlists   show,”  said. “The main thing I   keep  mind   just stay true   story    tell  what  might need musically.”

Case  point, from  same episode –  placement  Amos’ signature track “Cornflake Girl,”   groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album “Under  Pink.”

The song – which appropriately   lyric “Things  getting kind  gross” just  teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse)  about  ingest something unthinkable – “came  mind pretty quickly   possibility”  Felder.

“I felt that Amos’ lyrics could serve   befitting launchpad   first episode’ ending –  only   reflection  Young Shauna’ state  mind,”  noted, “ also   reflection   past  present moods  mentalities lived    other ‘Yellowjackets’ characters  Season 2.”

Felder’ work  challenging,   sense that there  often  ideal wish-list selection   song during  certain moment  each script, which then might change either   something technical  because  needs   scene evolve during production,   result  many elements, including  actors’ performances.

“Everyone   team always wants  best song-select possible  enhance  story,”  said. “When    post (production),  common question that comes  among  during  collaboration process  simply, ‘Do  think   beat this?’”

During that collaborative process, Felder says  doesn’ “believe there   exact roadmap into   merge songs with  given scene  story.”

“I always , ‘Let  picture tell  what  needs.’ (Kind  like  Wilderness I guess?)”

Another moment that feels perfectly melded   music playing   -infamous ‘last supper’ scene from last week’ second episode, which boasts Radiohead’ “Climbing By The Walls” from their mindblowing 1995 album “OK Computer”   soundtrack.

“The song seems  refer  those unspeakable monsters that  live  ’ head,” Felder noted, referencing  strange collective hallucinations  group undergoes while cannibalizing   their . “I ’ think   more perfect   hauntingly accent (that) scene, ... ‘ feast.’”

To drive home just  important music    specific ambient feel  “Yellowjackets,”  need look  further than  super creepy Season 2 trailer   show, which features Florence + The Machine’ exceptional  haunting rendition  No Doubt’ timeless 1995 , “Just A Girl.”

“We tried  really  some horror elements  this iconic song    tone   show. And  someone ’ first musical love   punk  Gwen Stefani,    dream .”

Of  collaboration with “Yellowjackets,” Morrisette, , felt inspired   show.

“I  parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’   perspective while songwriting:  sheer intensity, that going   jugular with  fear around going   profane,” Morissette said   statement. “I’ strived  entire career  support  empowerment  women  sensitives,    world through  female lens,  what’  wonderful about this show  that each character  allowed   dynamic  complex  opposed  oversimplified, reduced versions  women.

Even though Israel eased  2 1/2-month blockade   territory  May,  groups  only  trickle  assistance  getting into  enclave  that Palestinians face catastrophic levels  hunger 21 months into  Israeli offensive launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

Despite  mounting desperation, there’ been  formal declaration  famine.

UN says Gaza’ hunger crisis  worsening

Gaza’ population  roughly 2 million Palestinians relies almost entirely  outside . Israel’ offensive  wiped  what  already limited local food production. Israel’ blockade, along with ongoing fighting  chaos inside  territory,  further limited people’ access  food.

The U.N. World Food Program says Gaza’ hunger crisis  reached “  astonishing levels  desperation.” Nearly 100,000 women  children  suffering from severe acute malnutrition,   third  Gaza’ population  going days without eating, Ross Smith,  agency’ director  emergencies, said Monday.

Gaza’ Health Ministry said Tuesday that more than 100 people have died while showing signs  hunger  malnutrition, mostly children.

It   give their exact cause  death. The ministry, part   Hamas- government,  staffed  medical professionals   figures   deaths  seen   U.N.  other experts   most reliable estimate  casualties.

Famine occurs when these conditions  

The leading international authority  food crises   Integrated Food Security Phase Classification,  IPC, first    2004 during  famine  Somalia. It includes more than  dozen U.N. agencies,  groups, governments  other bodies.

Famine  appear  pockets — sometimes small ones —   formal classification requires caution.

The IPC  only declared famine   times —  Somalia  2011,  South Sudan  2017  2020,  last year  parts  Sudan’ western Darfur region. Tens  thousands  believed  have died  Somalia  South Sudan.

It rates  area   famine when  least   three conditions  confirmed:

— 20%  households have  extreme lack  food,   essentially starving.

— At least 30%  children  months  five years  suffer from acute malnutrition  wasting, meaning they’  thin  their height.

— At least  people  four children under five  10,000  dying daily   starvation   interaction  malnutrition  disease.

Gaza poses  major challenge  experts because Israel severely limits access   territory, making  difficult   some cases impossible  gather data.

Famine declarations usually come from  U.N.  governments

While  IPC says    “primary mechanism” used   international community  conclude whether  famine  happening  projected,  typically doesn’ make such  declaration itself.

Often, U.N. officials together with governments will make  formal statement based   analysis from  IPC.

But  IPC says once  famine  declared ’ already  late. While   prevent further deaths,  means many people will have died   time  famine  declared.

It’  always clear that hunger   cause  death

Most cases  severe malnutrition  children arise through  combination  lack  nutrients along with  infection, leading  diarrhea  other symptoms that cause dehydration, said Alex  Waal, author  “Mass Starvation: The History  Future  Famine”  executive director   World Peace Foundation.

“There   standard guidelines  physicians  classify cause  death  ‘malnutrition’  opposed  infection,”  said.

When famine occurs, there  often relatively  deaths from hunger alone, with  more people dying from  combination  malnutrition, disease  other forms  deprivation. All  these count  excess deaths — separate from violence — that   attributed   food crisis  famine,  said.

The   made  hard   accurate information

Israel’ offensive  gutted Gaza’ health system  displaced some 90%   population. With hospitals damaged  overwhelmed   casualties,    difficult  screen people  malnutrition  collect precise data  deaths.

“Data  surveillance systems  incomplete  eroded,” said James Smith,  emergency doctor  lecturer  humanitarian policy   University College London  spent more than  months  Gaza.

“Which means that  health indicators —   death toll —  known    underestimation,”  said.

Even when famine  declared,  response   lacking

A declaration  famine should  theory galvanize  international community  rush food  those  need . But with  budgets already stretched,    politics throwing  obstacles, that doesn’ always happen.

“There    , huge bank account”  draw , said OCHA’ Laerke. “The fundamental problem  that  build  fire engine   respond.”

Aid groups  plenty  food  other   been gathered  Gaza’ borders,  Israel  allowing only  small amount  enter. Within Gaza, gunfire, chaos  looting have plagued  distribution  food.

The Israeli military says   facilitated  entry  some 4,500  trucks since -May. That’  below  600 trucks   that  groups   needed,  which entered during  -week ceasefire earlier this year. An Israeli-backed American contractor  also distributing food.

U.N. agencies  Israeli restrictions,   breakdown    order, make  difficult  distribute  food that does come .

“Only  massive scale-  food  distributions  stabilize this spiraling situation, calm anxieties  rebuild  trust within communities that more food  coming,”  World Food Program said over  weekend. “An agreed ceasefire  long overdue.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Department  Labor  aiming  rewrite  repeal more than 60 “obsolete” workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements  home health care workers  people with disabilities  standards governing exposure  harmful substances.

If approved,  wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions  constructions sites   mines,  limit  government’ ability  penalize employers  workers  injured  killed while engaging  inherently risky activities such  movie stunts  animal training.

The Labor Department says  goal   reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations,   deliver  President Donald Trump’ commitment  restore American prosperity through deregulation.

“The Department  Labor  proud  lead    eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth  limit opportunity,” Secretary  Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said   statement, which boasted  “most ambitious proposal  slash  tape   department across  federal government.”

Critics   proposals would  workers  greater risk  harm, with women  members  minority groups bearing  disproportionate impact.

“People   very great risk  dying    already,” Rebecca Reindel,  AFL-CIO union’ occupational safety  health director, said. “This  something that  only going  make  problem worse.”

The proposed changes have several stages   through before they  take effect, including  public comment period  each .

Here’  look  some   rollbacks under consideration:

No minimum wage  home health care workers

Home health care workers help elderly  medically fragile people  preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet , accompanying clients  doctor appointments  performing other tasks. Under    Labor Department’ proposals,  estimated 3.7 million workers employed  home care agencies could  paid below  federal minimum wage — currently $7.25  hour —  made ineligible  overtime   they aren’ covered  corresponding state laws.

The proposed rule would reverse changes made  2013 under former President Barack Obama  revert   regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that  lowering labor  compliance costs,  revisions might expand  home care market  help keep frail individuals  their homes  longer.

Judy Conti, director  government affairs   National Employment Law Project, said  organization plans  work hard  defeat  proposal. Home health workers  subject  injuries from lifting clients,  “before those (2013) regulations,   very common  home care workers  work 50, 60  maybe even more hours  week, without getting  overtime ,” Conti said.

Others endorse  proposal, including  Independent Women’ Forum,  conservative nonprofit based  Virginia. Women often bear  brunt  family caregiving responsibilities,  making home care more affordable would help women balance work  personal responsibilities,  group’ president, Carrie Lukas, said.

“We’ pleased    Trump administration moving forward  rolling back some  what    counterproductive micromanaging  relationships that were making  hard  people    care they need,” Lukas said.

Samantha Sanders, director  government affairs  advocacy   nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said  repeal would  constitute    women.

“Saying  actually ’ think they need those protections would  pretty devastating   workforce that performs really essential work   very heavily dominated  women,  women  color  particular,” Sanders said.

Protections  migrant farm workers

Last year,  Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections  migrant farmworkers  held H-2A visas. The current administration says most  those rules placed unnecessary  costly requirements  employers.

Under   proposal,  Labor Department would rescind  requirement  most employer-provided transportation  have seat belts  those agriculture workers.

The department  also proposing  reverse  2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation  activities such  filing  complaint, testifying  participating   investigation, hearing  proceeding.

“There’  long history  retaliation against workers  speak  against abuses  farm work. And with H-2A ’ even worse because  employer  just  renew your visa,” said Lori Johnson, senior attorney  Farmworker Justice.

Michael Marsh, president  CEO   National Council  Agricultural Employers, applauded  deregulation efforts, saying farmers were  with thousands  pages  regulations pertaining  migrant farmworkers  recent years.

“Can  imagine  farmer     spouse trying  navigate 3,000  pages  regulation  18 months  then  liable  every   them?”  asked.

Adequate lighting  construction spaces

The Occupational Safety  Health Administration, part   Labor Department, wants  rescind  requirement  employers  provide adequate lighting  construction sites, saying  regulation doesn’ substantially reduce  significant risk.

OSHA said  employers fail  correct lighting deficiencies  construction worksites,  agency  issue citations under  “general duty clause.” The clause requires employers  provide  place  employment free from recognized hazards which  likely  cause death  serious physical harm.

Worker advocates think getting    specific construction site requirement    idea. “There have been many fatalities where workers fall through  hole   floor, where there’  adequate lighting,” Reindel said. “It’  very obvious thing that employers should address,  unfortunately ’   those things where  need  standard,  ’ violated   time.”

Mine safety

Several proposals could impact safety procedures  mines. For example, employers have  submit plans  ventilation  preventing roof collapses  coal mines  review   Labor Department’ Mine Safety  Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers  require mine operators  take additional steps  improve those plans.

The Labor Department wants   that authority, saying  current regulations give  district manager  ability  draft  create laws without soliciting comments  action  Congress.

Similarly,  department  proposing  strip district managers  their ability  require changes  mine health  safety training programs.

Limiting OSHA’ reach

The general duty clause allows OSHA  punish employers  unsafe working conditions when there’  specific standard  place  cover  situation.

An OSHA proposal would exclude  agency from applying  clause  prohibit, restrict  penalize employers  “inherently risky professional activities that  intrinsic  professional, athletic,  entertainment occupations.”

A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers  journalists  among  types  workers  limitation would apply .

“It  simply  plausible  assert that Congress, when passing  Occupational Safety  Health Act, silently intended  authorize  Department  Labor  eliminate familiar sports  entertainment practices, such  punt returns   NFL, speeding  NASCAR,   whale show  SeaWorld,”  proposed rule reads.

Debbie Berkowitz,  served  OSHA chief  staff during  Obama administration, said  thinks limiting  agency’ enforcement authority would   mistake.

“Once  start taking that threat away,  could return  where they’ throw safety   wind, because there  other production pressures they have,” Berkowitz said.

But  persistence, even   weakened state, only made Osbourne more beloved.

--------------------------------------------------
Black Sabbath, ‘Paranoid’ (1970)

Black Sabbath’ best-known song,  highest-charting single, started    afterthought. The producer Rodger Bain asked  group  come  with  filler track    running time   second LP. In 20 minutes,   together  radio-ready rocker about   battling persistent mental malaise, inspired  bouts  depression that Butler  experiencing   time. Osbourne’ plaintive, high-pitched delivery soared over Iommi’ locomotive riffs,  drove home  pathos  lines like “Can  help  occupy  brain?” “Paranoid” would remain  staple   singer  close  50 years, closing  shows  both  final solo tour dates  2018, Sabbath’ farewell   year prior   Back   Beginning concert  performed this month  Birmingham. “None   thought   anything special when  recorded ,” Osbourne wrote   song   2009 memoir. “But [expletive] hell,   catchy.”

Black Sabbath, ‘Changes’ (1972)

Sabbath   softer side , epitomized  this piano-driven tear-jerker from “Vol. 4,”  template  numerous Ozzy ballads across  decades. The singer’ guileless whine easily adapted   R&B-esque feel   tune, collectively written   band  response   drummer’ romantic hardships. “Tony just  down  came  with this beautiful riff, I hummed  melody over  ,  Geezer wrote these heartbreaking lyrics about  breakup Bill  going through with  wife   time,” Osbourne recalled   memoir. “Changes” would have  long afterlife, revived both   duet between  singer   daughter Kelly,    veteran soul singer Charles Bradley   wrenching cover.

Following  firing from Sabbath,  depressed Osbourne assumed that  rock-star heyday  behind . But  chance meeting with Randy Rhoads —  classically trained virtuoso, then playing guitar  Quiet Riot — soon gave   powerful second wind. Osbourne hired Rhoads after  dazzling audition,   pair teamed with  bassist-lyricist Bob Daisley  write “Crazy Train,”  singer’ debut solo single  arguably  career-defining anthem. Daisley’ words alluded  political unrest   threat  ,  paired with Osbourne’ piercing belt  Rhoads’ triumphant riffs  finger-busting leads,  song sounded like  manifesto   life that  constantly  danger  jumping  tracks.

“Suicide Solution” will always  remembered   song that incited  legal  PR nightmare  Osbourne when  parents   California teen  died  suicide filed  suit — eventually dismissed — claiming their child  been influenced   track,  deep  from  singer’ solo debut, “Blizzard  Ozz.” But  Osbourne   -writer Daisley both maintained,  song  actually  warning against  dangers  alcoholism, inspired  part   death   AC/DC singer Bon Scott. (The word “solution”   title refers,   singer once explained,  “liquid,    .”) Musically,   another example   potency  Osbourne’ first solo band,   howled about  double-edged sword  intoxication — “Take  bottle  drown your sorrows/Then  floods away tomorrows” — over Rhoads’ swaggering riffs, which suggested  souped- Sabbath.

Rhoads’ tragic 1982 death   private-plane crash marked  another crossroads  Osbourne,   singer spent  rest   decade experimenting with lineups. “The Ultimate Sin,”  transitional fourth LP, yielded  moody, streamlined “Shot   Dark,”  first Osbourne solo single  crack  Billboard Hot 100. The song originated   years earlier with Wildlife —  band featuring  bassist Phil Soussan,  later signed  with Osbourne —  even  “Shot   Dark” wasn’ written  , Ozzy sells  expertly, fully inhabiting  sleek -metal feel.

‘Close My Eyes Forever,’ with Lita Ford (1988)

The only time Osbourne made  Top 10   U.S. singles chart  with this ballad about  tortured love affair,  duet with Lita Ford — then being managed  Sharon Osbourne — that grew    casual studio hangout  appeared   former Runaways guitarist’ third solo album. The pair’ voices  excellently matched, with Osbourne craning  some   highest notes  record while Ford favored  husky lower register. (Osbourne would later   less commercially successful duet with another female -star:  version  Steppenwolf’ “Born  Be Wild” featuring Miss Piggy.)

Eventually, researchers hope  engineer mosquitoes with this approach  release them into  wild.

"These mosquitoes will spread  their   gradually transform  malaria-transmitting mosquito population   that cannot transmit malaria," says George Dimopoulos,  biologist  Johns Hopkins University  study -author.

What about consequences?

But gene drive technology  controversial.

"Gene drives could have -reaching, unpredictable negative consequences," says Dana Perls, senior program manager  emerging technologies  Friends   Earth,  environmental -profit. Because they distort normal patterns  inheritance, " genetic changes from  gene drive   population  mosquitoes  very likely  persist   long time, possibly permanently."

Critics worry that gene drives designed  spread  tiny change   genome could   mutating  affect other parts   genome. That could result  unanticipated changes spreading fast through  population before researchers would have  chance  stop , potentially upending  delicate balance   ecosystem.

Still, researchers  exploring several gene editing strategies. Some   suppress mosquito populations  rendering individuals infertile. But there  worries that wiping  mosquitoes could have unintended consequences  ecosystems —  example  removing  food source  birds  bats.

Another strategy   engineer mosquitoes with  genes that would make proteins that mess with  parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming  bugs.

Dimopoulos   colleagues wanted  take  different approach,  that messed with  parasite,  without adding  entirely  gene. They settled   gene called FREP1. It helps mosquitoes feed  blood. But  also appears   important   parasites, which    complete their crucial journey   salivary glands  ways researchers ' fully understand.

Some mosquitoes have  small genetic change that seems  disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR,  gene editing technology that  very precisely change  genome,  create  nearly-identical Anopheles stephensi groups,  with  normal FREP1 gene   with  variant. The variant  very small, changing just  amino acid,  basic building blocks  proteins.

But that small change   effects.

Mosquitoes with  edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites   salivary glands,  median  zero compared with thousands  -edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites   , . Otherwise,  insects appeared perfectly healthy.

It' unclear exactly  much this genetic tweak would impair  mosquito' ability  transmit malaria. But previous research suggests "something   order   90% reduction  malaria transmission would  more  less what ' expect," says Ethan Bier,  geneticist   University  California San Diego  study -author. "I  surprised myself that  single amino acid change could  that."

Next,  researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with  gene drive. It took just 10 generations   variant  spread  over 90%  their laboratory population.

"It' really excellent work," says Anthony James,  molecular biologist   University  California Irvine  wasn' involved   study,  works  introducing  resistance genes  mosquitoes. Since  change  naturally occurring,  says  could  "marginally more acceptable"  people wary  genetic engineering.

"It' good  have more than  approach available,"  says. That' especially important   malaria parasite evolves resistance against these  tools.

Then they poured five gallon buckets  sulfuric acid  hydrochloric acid …   that certain stew   while," remembers Smith,  frequently visited China during this period. "When  storms come ,  that acid just washes ."

The mining left China' terrain scarred with lasting groundwater  soil pollution. Local residents staged periodic protests against rare earth mining,   industry provided local governments with abundant revenue,  they repeatedly ignored central government orders  close down dirty mines.

LONDON (AP) — Britain’ Supreme Court  Wednesday quashed  convictions   financial market traders accused  manipulating benchmark interest rates     biggest scandals  come    global financial crisis  2008.

The charges against Tom Hayes,  former Citigroup  UBS trader,  Carlo Palombo,  worked  Barclays, centered around alleged efforts  influence  London Inter-Bank Offered Rate,  Libor,   euro currency equivalent Euribor, which were used    interest rates  trillions  dollars  loans  other financial products around  world.

The court ruled that  convictions  Hayes  Palombo were unfair because  judges  their separate cases gave inaccurate instructions  jurors. That effectively prevented jurors from considering   question  whether  traders  acted dishonestly.

“That misdirection undermined  fairness   trial,” Judge George Leggatt wrote   82-page decision backed   five members   panel that heard  case.

Hayes  convicted  August 2015  sentenced   maximum  14 years  prison, which  later reduced  11 years. Palombo, convicted  March 2019,  sentenced  four years  prison. Both  were released  2021.

“It destroyed  family, I missed most   ’ childhood,” Hayes told  BBC.

“For  long I’ been  international fugitive …   I  move  with  life,   ,”  added.

The decision came after  U.S. Second Circuit Court  Appeal  2022 overturned  convictions   traders charged with similar crimes   United States. Hayes  Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected  British judges, were allowed  take their case   U.K. Supreme Court after that ruling.

The U.K.’ Serious Fraud Office began investigating alleged efforts  manipulate Libor  2012. That ultimately    conviction  nine bankers.

“We have considered this judgment   full circumstances carefully  determined  would     public interest    seek  retrial,”  SFO said  response   Supreme Court ruling.

Libor  Euribor were critical benchmarks that were once used    interest rates  everything from business loans  home mortgages  credit card debts. As  result, they also became central  more complex financial transactions such  those used  banks  businesses    interest rate fluctuations.

The benchmarks were vulnerable  manipulation because they were   banks that could profit from swings  interest rates.

Each , major international banks were asked  submit  interest rate  which they could borrow money from other banks. An average  those submissions  then used    daily Libor  Euribor rates.

During  financial crisis, regulators became aware that some banks were making artificially  Libor submissions  make their institutions seem more creditworthy. Some traders also sought  influence  submissions made  their banks  even small moves   benchmark rates could boost their profits.

Those risks became even more pronounced during  financial crisis, when lending dried   bankers   base their daily submissions   subjective assessment   market rather than actual loans.

Libor  Euribor were phased   recent years,  part because they were seen  worsening  financial crisis.

For  first time since devastating Fourth  July floods killed  least 137 people  Central Texas,  state’ Republican-controlled legislature  confronting  tragedy  what should  done  strengthen disaster preparedness amid growing criticism. Two specially convened committees opened  lengthy joint hearing Wednesday morning  praising aspects   emergency response   state level while also quickly highlighting problems with early warning systems, first responder communications  local emergency management.

Nim Kidd, director  Texas Department  Emergency Management, testified that some   300 field employees were staged  Hill County   before  flooding began, along with helicopters, boat squads  high-profile vehicles. But,  noted,  ominous forecast covered 35,000 square miles — virtually  equivalent  half  New England.

He outlined  timeline   state warnings unfolded based  National Weather Service  other forecasts even  creeks  rivers started rising dangerously   predawn darkness  July 4. A flash food emergency wasn’ declared until 4:23 ..,  noted,   wasn’ clear whether local officials received .

“When    your first call that people were  rooftops?” asked Sen. Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston).

About 30 minutes later, Kidd answered. He then continued: “Do  need  better system  warning? Yes. What does that look like? I ’ know … [] once  have this amazing system,  should have  authority  implement that? I still think local officials. But should there   backup  that? I think .”

Multiple issues exacerbated  response, according   testimony. Kidd said that once  arrived   flood zone that ,  couldn’ stay connected with San Antonio firefighters trying  assist rescues because they  “cheap Chinese radios.”

“We   state   better,” Kidd said,  refrain  repeated when explaining that  Texas, county  city emergency managers appointed  local leaders   required   qualified. He added that  state needs “ sincere focus  corrective action plans. We’     better    warning  notification systems   hazards.”

The legislature  back  Austin  part   30- special session called  Gov. Greg Abbott,  flood-related measures  among  priorities.

His targets include improving early warning systems  bolstering emergency communications  vulnerable areas   state,  well  relief funding   counties hardest  earlier this month. Lawmakers have filed more than  dozen similar bills that address more issues, such  tougher building standards  youth camps near floodplains   creation   real-time emergency communications system    Texas.

The search  victims  begun  wind down. Kerr County,  epicenter, suddenly announced several days  that  count  missing  dropped from nearly 100  3. At least  more people remained missing  Travis  Burnet counties, according  officials there.

Yet questions remain over   extreme loss  life could have been prevented,  Democrats  votes  proposals  address that  already entangled   politics  another Abbott priority — redrawing Democratic congressional districts,  President Donald Trump’ urging,  help Republicans  Washington protect their thin House majority.

National Democrats  urged their counterparts   legislature here  thwart  vote  redistricting  walking ,   lawmakers have  years past. But with flood-related bills pending,  walkout appears unlikely. By delaying votes   measures, Republicans  ensure enough Democrats stay  maintain  quorum.

Forty-eight  those Democratic legislators signed  letter this week urging  speaker  delay  debate  redistricting. “Texas families  grieving their dead  Texas communities  hurting,”  read. “In this special session, flood relief must come first.”

Abbott  Trump have deflected questions about what more could have been done ahead  time  save lives. The governor suggested  legislature pursue answers through special committees,    panels formed  hearing  initial testimony Wednesday. Witnesses were  invitation,  public comment allowed only online.

The flood damaged thousands  structures, county engineer Charlie Hastings told those gathered. It ,  said, “ monster tsunami that ripped through  community.”

State  local leaders have come under fire   lack  early warning systems along Hill Country rivers, particularly  Guadalupe, which  flanked  summer youth retreats. At   those, Camp Mystic, 25 girls,  counselors   longtime camp director perished.

The legislature concluded  last session  May, when  failed  pass bills  help communities like Kerr County better prepare  frequent flooding. The measures  been recommended last year   statewide flood plan that lawmakers ordered  2019   wake  Hurricane Harvey.

Despite such missteps, some Texas officials have rejected criticism, insisting  catastrophic flooding   Hill Country  impossible  predict. Others have said local residents balked  paying  upgrade flood warning systems.

“The public reeled   cost,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly recounted   briefing  early July.

Kerr County commissioners considered installing flood warning sirens, high water detection gauges  cellphone alerts several years   were stymied  state emergency managers, according  records  videos  public meetings.

Those accounts also show that  county  2021 declined  spend   more than $10 million  federal funds offered   Biden administration    warning system after facing pushback from residents  overwhelmingly supported Trump, then  former president.

House Speaker Dustin Burrows  Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick,  leads  state Senate, appointed nine members each    select committees. Both panels  chaired  Republicans, with 13 Republicans  five Democrats  members.

“This effort  about moving quickly  help Texans recover  laying  foundation  better protect  communities —   children — from future disasters,” Burrows said   statement.

Patrick  acknowledged that  public “demands answers”  said   statement that  legislature  just beginning  look “ every aspect  this tragic event.” The lieutenant governor,  staunch Trump ally,  advocating  emergency warning sirens   installed  flood-prone areas  next summer, when youth camps like  ones destroyed this month might reopen.

“Had   sirens along this area   down,  same type  sirens that they have  Israel when there’  attack coming, that would have blown very loudly, ’ possible that would’ saved some  these lives,” Patrick said   interview with Fox News.

Ahead  Wednesday’ hearing, Houston Rep. Ann Johnson (D) expressed concern about  willingness  state  federal lawmakers    flood prevention  relief. “Hopefully   answers  support from  Trump administration,”  said. “Because this  going  have  massive price .”

"He  stopped Congress     business  this week because  doesn' want  have  vote," Khanna told NPR' Morning Edition  Wednesday. "He knows  would lose  vote."

Johnson said  prevented  vote because while Congress  " moral responsibility  expose  evil  Epstein  everybody  involved  that … But  also have  equal moral responsibility  protect  innocent,  that   fine needle  thread," such  grand jury witnesses  were promised confidentiality during their testimony.

But Khanna said during  NPR interview that  resolution  -sponsored  release  Epstein files "clearly says that victims' identities should  protected, that  salacious pornography should  released," addressing Johnson' privacy concerns.

Khanna described growing support   discharge petition that would force  issue   House floor.

"The reality , I have  212 Democrats  will sign  discharge petition,"  added, " yesterday, when I spoke  Thomas Massie,  said that     about 11  12   Republican side;  only need ."

Several high-profile Republicans  align themselves with President Trump have also joined  push  release  Epstein files.

"Candidly, I  surprised," Khanna said. "Massie  I [have] done  War Powers resolution  stop    Iran. He   only Republican  . This time,  have Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Tim Burchett, Nancy Mace – some   most prominent MAGA voices,"  added.

For , Republican support reflects  larger test   campaign message from President Trump   administration' promise.

"They said they were going      corruption. They said they were going  expose  Epstein files. They said they weren' going  protect  rich  powerful. They said they were going     side   people," Khanna noted. "It   populist campaign they ,  this  seen   betrayal  that."

Khanna noted that Republicans upset over  Trump administration  members  Congress trying  block  release   Epstein files  " first thing, probably since Donald Trump walked down  elevator, that  truly split  base."

As calls  transparency grow louder,  Justice Department appears   taking steps   . Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  requested  meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell,  longtime Epstein associate  serving  20-year sentence  federal prison  child  trafficking  other crimes connected  Epstein' activities.

But  expectation that such  meeting would lead   public release  information  highly unlikely, according  Elliot Williams,  former deputy assistant attorney general during  Obama administration.

"I think they' hoping  quell  PR crisis that they'   middle  right ," Williams told NPR.

"Fundamentally '  good thing  meet with someone '  prison  might have useful information,"  said. "The problem , they' going  have  give   deal  some sort …   they have  acknowledge that, that could   huge, very embarrassing concession."

He continued: "There have been ample opportunities across three different presidential administrations,   information   … This really  about quelling public  internet speculation  more than going after people ' committed crimes."

"This idea that Todd Blanche  going   down with Ghislaine Maxwell  prison, transcribe  interview with ,  then immediately send   NPR   world    simply nonsense,"  added.

OK   truly American invention. It started    joke,   become    most widely used words   planet.

This week' installment  Word   Week traces  evolution.

Where  OK come from?

The origin  'OK' remained  mystery  much   existence —  even today, some still dispute  most accepted explanation. Over  years, theories have abounded: Some traced   French  Scottish roots. In  1960s, folk singer Pete Seeger popularized another idea, singing that "Choctaw gave   word OK" —  widely held belief   time,   that ultimately proved wrong.

"Early efforts  establish  origin  OK were imaginative  best, without documentation,  often just foolish," according   2011 article   Dictionaries Journal   Dictionary Society  North America.

Most scholars  fall  line behind  conclusions  Allen Walker Read,  Columbia University English professor      1960s  settle  mystery  OK' origin. He followed  trail back   playful misspelling  " correct"  " korrect." The term first appeared   Boston Morning Post  March 23, 1839, although "  probably been used colloquially before that," according  Doug Harper,  created  Online Etymology Dictionary. It germinates from  linguistic    time —  playful trend  unlike Cockney rhyming slang  which people "would abbreviate common phrases with deliberate, jocular misspellings,"  says.

In July 1839,  word appears   paragraph written   editor  The Baltimore Sun. He thanks "some anonymous gentleman   gift  bottles  wine …   pronounces  wine 'O.K.,'" Harper says.

Mark Cheathem, project director   papers  Martin Van Buren  professor  history  Cumberland University, notes that "conveniently … O.K. lined  with  nickname that  attached  Van Buren — 'Old Kinderhook,'"  reference   president' birthplace  Kinderhook, N.Y. Political nicknames were  vogue   time, Cheathem adds. Van Buren' predecessor, Andrew Jackson,  known  "Old Hickory,"   1840 rival, William Henry Harrison,  dubbed "Old Tippecanoe."

Van Buren' supporters formed "O.K. Clubs" aimed  energizing  candidate' political base, Cheathem says. Some contemporaneous accounts suggest  clubs also added "muscle"   campaign. Van Buren even began signing documents with "O.K."  reinforce  association.

Harper notes that OK  wielded  both parties   1840 election, with some newspapers claiming   time that  originated from  spelling blunder  Jackson — meant  mock  former president,  fellow Democrat like Van Buren. The story went that Jackson' postmaster general, Amos Kendall,  accused  mishandling accounts. When Jackson personally verified them,  instructed that they  bundled  marked "OK" — because,   said, "Amos   correct."

"It'  perfect headline word because '  short," Harper says. "In print ' difficult  figure   [] spell  ,"  says. On  other hand, "  also  abbreviation  could write with just  letters ...   covers    ground, meaning-wise."

Its usage   20th century grew thanks  American soldiers stationed abroad, says Harper. "If ' looking   global spread, I would really start with   world wars  right after them,"  says.

Around 1945, Harper says  sees examples  "people either celebrating  complaining that  French  starting   OK, which would   ultimate [barrier], I suppose,  such American slang."

The justices acted   emergency appeal from  Justice Department, which argued that  agency  under Trump’ control   president  free  remove commissioners without cause.

That’ what Trump   May, providing  reason  removing  three Democratic commissioners   five-person board, despite  federal  that allows commissioners   fired only  “neglect  duty  malfeasance.”

The court provided  brief, unsigned explanation that  case  similar  earlier ones  which  allowed Trump  fire board members  other independent agencies, whom Congress protected from arbitrary dismissals.

The three liberal justices dissented. “By means  such actions, this Court  facilitate  permanent transfer  authority, piece  piece  piece, from  branch  Government  another,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote  herself,  well  Justices Sonia Sotomayor  Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The commission helps protect consumers from dangerous products  issuing recalls, suing errant companies  more. The fired commissioners  been serving seven-year terms after being nominated  President Joe Biden.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox  Baltimore ruled  June that  dismissals were unlawful. Maddox sought  distinguish  commission’ role from those  other agencies where  Supreme Court  allowed firings   forward.

A month earlier,  high court’ conservative majority declined  reinstate members   National Labor Relations Board   Merit Systems Protection Board, finding that  Constitution appears  give  president  authority  fire  board members “without cause.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. automakers worry that President Donald Trump’ agreement  tariff Japanese vehicles  15% would  them   competitive disadvantage, saying they will face steeper import taxes  steel, aluminum  parts than their competitors.

“We need  review   details   agreement,  this   deal that will charge lower tariffs  Japanese autos with  U.S. content,” said Matt Blunt, president   American Automotive Policy Council, which represents  Big 3 American automakers, General Motors, Ford  Jeep-maker Stellantis.

Blunt said   interview  U.S. companies  workers “definitely    disadvantage” because they face  50% tariff  steel  aluminum   25% tariff  parts  finished vehicles, with some exceptions  products covered under  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that went into effect  2020.

The domestic automaker reaction reveals  challenge  enforcing policies across  world economy, showing that    Trump’ promises there   genuine tradeoffs from policy choices that risk serious blowback  politically important states such  Michigan  Wisconsin, where automaking  both  source  income   identity.

Trump portrayed  trade framework   major  after announcing   Tuesday, saying  would  hundreds  thousands  jobs   U.S. economy  open  Japanese economy  ways that could close  persistent trade imbalance. The agreement includes  15% tariff that replaces  25% import   Republican president  threatened  charge starting  Aug. 1. Japan would also  together $550 billion  invest  U.S. projects   “direction”   president,  White House said.

The framework with Japan will remove regulations that prevent American vehicles from being sold  that country,  White House  said, adding that  would  possible  vehicles built  Detroit   shipped directly  Japan  ready   sold.

But Blunt said that foreign auto producers, including  U.S., Europe  South Korea, have just  6% share  Japan, raising skepticism that simply having  open market that  Trump administration says will exist  that country will  sufficient.

“Tough   crack,  I’  very surprised     meaningful market penetration  Japan,” Blunt said.

Asked  Wednesday’ briefing about whether Trump’ sectoral tariffs such  those  autos were  subject  possible change, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that  issue  been going through  Commerce Department.

The framework with Japan  also  indication that some nations simply    preferential  have   tariff rate rather than  whipsawed  Trump’ changes  import taxes since April. But   moment, both Japan   United Kingdom with  quotas  auto exports might enjoy  competitive edge   U.S.

The statement urged “ Trump administration  swiftly reach similar agreements with other allies  partners, especially  European Union, South Korea, Canada  Mexico.”

The Japanese framework could give automakers  other countries grounds  pushing  changes   Trump administration’ tariffs regime. The president  previously said that  values flexibility  negotiating import taxes. The USMCA    review next year.

Ford, GM  Stellantis  “have every right   upset,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president  consultancy AutoForecast Solutions. But “Honda, Toyota,  Nissan still import vehicles from Mexico  Canada, where  current levels  tariffs   higher than those applied  Japanese imports. Most   high-volume models from Japanese brands  already produced  North America.”

Fiorani noted that among   exceptions   Toyota 4Runner,  Mazda CX-5   Subaru Forester,  most   other imports fill niches that   small  warrant production   U.S.

“There will  negotiations between  U.S.  Canada  Mexico,   will probably result  tariffs  higher than 15%,” Fiorani added, “ nobody seems     hurry  negotiate around  last Trump administration’ free trade agreement.”

Nations must   climate change  could  held responsible,  U.N. court rules

The  United Nations court  ruled that nations  obligated under international   limit climate change,  countries that '  could  held legally responsible  climate damages elsewhere.

The decision     many small countries vulnerable  climate impacts, which pushed   issue   heard   International Court  Justice (ICJ).

It'  court' first major ruling  climate change,   decision  only advisory, meaning that countries   legally bound  . Still, legal experts   could   boost  other climate change lawsuits pending  national courts around  world.

"It' really groundbreaking," says Maria Antonia Tigre, director  Global Climate Change Litigation  Columbia Law School. "I think  will create this  wave  climate litigation."

The case  championed   South Pacific island nation  Vanuatu, which  been among  loudest voices calling  stronger international climate action, alongside other island nations. The -lying countries face dire risks from rising  levels  more intense cyclones.

In court proceedings  December, Vanuatu  other nations argued that countries have  obligation    climate change under international laws protecting  environment  human rights. In  ruling today,  ICJ agreed .

"In order  guarantee  effective enjoyment  human rights, states must take measures  protect  climate system  other parts   environment," Judge Yuji Iwasawa read from  court' opinion.

The court also found that  countries fail  curb their heat-trapping emissions from fossil fuels, they could    hook    climate change-related damages  other countries. Those kinds  payments have been  point  contention between major emitters  lower-income counties  annual climate change negotiations.

The U.S. generally doesn' consider ICJ decisions   binding. Earlier this year, President Trump also pulled  U.S.    major international climate accord,  2015 Paris climate agreement.

Still, smaller countries  they hope  ICJ' decision will   turning point  international climate negotiations.

"Today ' been  landmark milestone  climate action," said Vanuatu' climate minister Ralph Regenvanu. "It'  very important course correction  this critically important time."

Island nations push  climate change ruling

For years, -lying countries around  world have argued that climate change   existential threat. Sea levels have already risen about 8 inches since  Industrial Revolution,   pace  accelerating. Vanuatu  looking  relocating entire villages from  coast. Cyclones have taken  toll   South Pacific country   getting more intense   climate heats .

With  population  around 300,000, Vanuatu  produced  relatively tiny share  global emissions from burning fossil fuels, which trap heat  warm  planet. The majority  emissions have come from larger  richer countries such   U.S.,  European Union  China.

But Vanuatu officials argue ' bearing  brunt   problem.

"We find ourselves   front lines   crisis    create,  crisis that threatens  very existence," Regenvanu said before  ICJ last December.

Vanutau   coalition  countries  call   ICJ  rule  climate change, spurred    group  students from  Pacific Islands . The court, based   Hague, rules  international   disputes between countries. Close  100 countries filed testimonies, making   largest case  court  heard .

Are countries obligated    climate change?

The court took   questions:  countries obligated    climate change,  what   legal consequences  they cause harm?

At  hearings,  U.S. argued that negotiations through international agreements such   Paris climate accord   best   address climate change.

"Cooperative efforts through that regime provide  best hope  protecting  climate system   benefit  present  future generations," said Margaret Taylor,  represented  U.S. Department  State   legal proceedings under  Biden administration.

In  ruling today,  ICJ found that countries  bound  curb emissions  greenhouse gases under international . That includes taking actions such  limiting    production  fossil fuels like coal,   natural  –  even government subsidies  those industries. It also found that states   held responsible  specific damage caused  climate change. That' made possible  advances  climate science that  helping  pinpoint  much climate change contributes  specific disasters.

At  same time,  ICJ recognized that  advisory ruling  have  minimal impact.

"International …   important  ultimately limited role  resolving this problem,"  judgment reads. "A complete solution  this daunting,  self-inflicted, problem requires  contribution   fields  human knowledge, whether , science, economics   other."

Potential international impacts

The case could influence hundreds  other climate change lawsuits around  world, adding evidence  plaintiffs   seeking  spur governments  . Cases have been filed   U.S.  European countries like  Netherlands, where  court ruled that  Dutch state must   greenhouse  emissions .

"This being really  biggest case that  have seen  climate litigation,  status   weight   court  really influence    these cases," Tigre says.

The ICJ decision could also  cited   COP30 international climate negotiations this fall  Brazil. There, smaller nations like Vanuatu will continue  make  case  compensation from wealthier countries   damages from climate change, known  "loss  damage" payments.

SMMT said  US-UK tariff deal which  since come into effect could help confidence, while  government said  electric vehicle (EV) grants would "boost"  industry.

Uncertainty over tariffs   US –  UK industry' second biggest market – meant some firms slowed  stopped production   first half  this year.

A deal with  US  reduce tariffs from 27.5%  10%  announced  May came into effect  30 June, with SMMT recording  small rise  vehicle production  June.

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said  half year production figures were "depressing"  that  hoped that  first half  this year marked " nadir"   UK auto industry.

The SMMT welcomed  EV grants,   said   system lacked clarity   been introduced without consulting  industry.

However,  SMMT does  expect  return  2021 production levels   million vehicles      decade.

Mr Hawes said that  government' target  1.3 million vehicles  year  2035  "quite some ambition from where  ", adding that " clearly require  least ,   ,  entrants  come into UK production"    target.

Production  electrified vehicles rose 1.8% with battery, hybrid,  plug- hybrid vehicles accounting   record  more than   five  vehicles produced.

Last week  government confirmed  will reintroduce grants    £3,750  some EVs  priced   below £37,000.

While  SMMT welcomed  return  incentives that were abolished  2022, there  widespread confusion about which vehicles will qualify   discounts.

The eligibility  level  discount will  determined   amount  carbon emitted   production   vehicle   battery. They will only  offered  manufacturers that have verified science-based targets with thresholds  government    defined.

It' expected that Chinese  Korean vehicles will  meet  criteria  little else  clear.

"The difficulty ,  ' know. Nobody knows,  nobody,  even government, really knows , which models  which brands will qualify," said Mr Hawes.

"I think  industry  still trying   clarity behind  application. Right  your dealer cannot tell  whether  model   considering  eligible."

He said clarity  needed soon  September   second biggest month    registrations.

A transport department spokesperson said  expects "dozens  models   eligible   electric  grant, which will provide  substantial boost   industry  save drivers thousands  pounds".

In  decade  2023-24,  number  students with  mental health condition almost quadrupled, according   Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), increasing every year  2022-23 before dipping slightly  2023-24. That year, some 122,430 students   UK (   total  2.9 million) said they   mental health condition. Most were undergraduates,   majority were women.

Part  this   down  . Late adolescence (18  21)  what Dr Sandi Mann,  senior psychology lecturer   University  Central Lancashire, calls  "peak ages"  many mental health problems, including OCD, anxiety  depression. There   recent parallel data that directly compares  mental health  young people    attend university  higher education. But combining  stresses  late adolescence, academic pressure, learning   live independently, ,  some, part-time work, creates  "prime conditions"  mental health issues, argues Dr Mann. A lack  "resilience" also concerns . "I'  talking about serious mental health issues, such  severe OCD, anxiety  depression,"  says. "Of course they need help. But young people seem  struggle more coping with  -- stresses  everyday life."

Some have argued that society  increasingly pathologising normal experiences,  that encouraging people  talk about mental health doesn' help everyone. Ben Locke,  American psychologist  researches US colleges' support services,  argued that many mental health assessment tools cross over with normal human distress, leading  more people being told they need professional help. But Dr Sarah Sweeney,  incoming chairwoman   student services organisation Amosshe,  head  student support  wellbeing  Lancaster University, argues that encouraging young people  talk about mental health  removed some   stigma. She also believes, however, that more could  done  educate people about when something   mental health challenge  problem. "Which  different from  diagnosed mental illness,"  stresses.

'We'  trained  this'

Another part   challenge  that  first point  contact  students reporting mental health challenges  often their personal tutor -  academic. Dr Mann stresses that  personal tutor - sometimes called  academic advisor -    mental health practitioner. Their main role should  signposting  sometimes referring students  counselling services. One senior humanities lecturer   University  Manchester,  asked    named, says that  their department, personal tutors  given  "handbook  academic advising"  some PowerPoint slides, which they describe   "series  generic questions  "  specific situations.

The level  training  personal tutor  given varies between universities. But often  academic' first indication   issue  during casual conversations with  student about  submitting  piece  work  time. This  mean tutors "' really know that [they ] intervening   mental health crisis", they explain. "And '  problem that '  trained ." They summed   situation  universities  "grim". "It  gone from being  really serious problem  being  really major crisis… People  swamped." The University  Manchester said that " student-facing staff  access  rolling programme  training  responding  mental health difficulties  students",   mental health nurses,  that there  "clear  rapid" routes  escalate cases. All academic advisors receive training  have  support   advisor network,  said. It added that   significantly increased investment  student health  wellbeing   last  years.

'People  slip through  gaps'

Some students argue  sheer number  services,   levels  complexity around   access ,  make  difficult    help they need. Generally, after speaking   personal tutor,  second step   student might   meet with  wellbeing team, which  help them take steps  "manage stress   transition  university", including advice  topics like good sleep  managing anxiety. Wellbeing advisers will typically assess whether  student' case needs escalating,  might refer students  specialist support like disability services  counselling through  university' -house team. Students   seriously unwell -  those     risk  themselves  others -  escalated   final step. This usually means making contact with  local health authorities about managing risk. Dr Sweeney says this    " "   your head around.

"Even   mental health professional ' really difficult  navigate," adds Dr Mann. "Nobody really knows    ." There ,  both universities  mental health services more widely,  "real danger that people  slip through  gaps". Universities  spending more  these services: their spend increased  73%  average   past five years, according  research  72 UK universities  Times Radio  The Sunday Times released  January. This  despite almost half  universities expecting    financial deficit this summer, according   Office  Students. "Student services    ,   needs   properly resourced,  there  increasing demand," says Dr Sweeney. "We could  part   whole drive  streamline…   have  resource those services properly  them   effective."

What role should universities play?

Some academics argue     university'   look after students like  school teacher would. Another lecturer  Manchester,  prefers    named, argues that: "Students  adults, they  over 18 when they  coming  university". However, they concede that   "very hard   human level"  just turn students away. Dr Sweeney similarly emphasises that universities   mental illness treatment centres. (Indeed, student services will always tell  student  serious crisis  immediate stress  seek help from their GP  NHS services.) But some students     long NHS waiting times, including  mental health services.

Abrahart Family "If universities ' provide  safe  supportive environment then they     purpose," argues Natasha' father Bob

One argument  that universities need closer collaboration with NHS authorities  improve mental health care. In Manchester, local authorities have created  scheme called  Greater Manchester Universities Mental Health Service, under which local universities, including  University  Manchester,  escalate  case meaning authorities respond faster. Dr Sweeney says  scheme  currently working well. But  acknowledges that   ,  relies  local NHS services having  capacity. However, others believe universities need  take  more responsibility. Natasha Abrahart' father Bob    them. "If universities ' provide  safe  supportive environment then they     purpose,"  argues.

The duty  care debate

In May 2022, Bob, together with Natasha' mother Maggie, sued  university.

The University  Bristol   responded   request   comment.

Student suicide rates  believed   lower than  general population. The Office  National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 319 students died  suicide between  2016-17  2019-20 academic years. However  stresses that there   central database recording student suicides - instead, they cross-referenced death certificates with student records  identify potential cases  student suicides. In May,  report   National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide  Safety  Mental Health (NCISH)   University  Manchester concluded universities needed   more  prevent student suicides, including mandatory mental health awareness  suicide prevention training  staff. Bob  Maggie  calling   government  introduce  statutory duty  care  higher education,   legal obligation  protect students from harm. The court  Bristol found there   "statute  precedent" establishing this duty  care.

The Department  Education says    plans  introduce this because higher education providers already  " duty  care   cause harm  their students through  university'  actions". Both Amosshe  Universities UK, which represents university vice-chancellors, oppose  change . Amosshe says  would "place unrealistic expectations over what higher education providers  control". Yet most universities acknowledge something must change. Dr Sweeney says  sector could  doing more,  there    standardised student services model across higher education. But  also adds university   "more supportive environment than  workplace". Meanwhile Dr Mann believes that   about giving students  "scaffolding"  thrive.

The Muscogee Nation Supreme Court  ruled  favor   descendants  former slaves held   tribe

The Muscogee Nation Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that  descendants  people once enslaved   tribe  entitled  tribal citizenship.

The court found that  tribal nation’ citizenship board violated  1866 treaty when  denied  applications  Rhonda Grayson  Jeffrey Kennedy  2019 because they could  identify  lineal descendant   tribe.

“Are ,   Nation, bound  treaty promises made  many years ? Today,  answer   affirmative, because this  what Mvskoke  demands,”  court wrote   opinion.

The Muscogee Nation    five tribes  Oklahoma that once practiced slavery,   that 1866 treaty with  U.S. government,  tribe both abolished   granted citizenship   formerly enslaved. But  1979,  tribal nation adopted  constitution that restricted membership   descendants  people listed  “Muscogee (Creek) Indians  blood”   Dawes Rolls,  census  members   five tribes created around 1900.

When  Dawes Rolls were created, people were listed   separate rolls: those  were Muscogee  those  were identified   U.S. government  Freedmen. In  ruling Wednesday,  court remanded  matter back   Muscogee Nation' citizenship board  directed   apply  Treaty  1866  Grayson  Kennedy' applications,  well   future applicants   trace  ancestor  either roll.

The decision could create  path  tribal citizenship  thousands   members    Muscogee  blood.

The ruling   long-awaited affirmation  their ancestors  their rightful place   Muscogee Nation, said Rhonda Grayson.

“While this victory honors  past,  also offers  meaningful opportunity  healing  reconciliation. It’ time   come together, rebuild trust,  move forward   united Nation, ensuring future generations never again face exclusion  erasure,"  said   statement  The Associated Press.

“When I heard  ruling, I felt generations   family exhale  once," Kennedy added   statement. “Our ancestors signed that treaty  good faith,  today  Court finally honored their word.”

The court also found that  reference  “ blood”   Muscogee Nation' constitution  unlawful, which could mean  tribe will have  overhaul parts   governing document. One provision   constitution requires that citizens   least  quarter Muscogee “ blood”    office.

“We  currently reviewing  order  understand  basis  well   implications   processes,” Muscogee Nation Chief David Hill said   statement. “It   necessary     reconsideration  this order  receive clarity  that   ensure that  move forward   legal, constitutional manner.”

Successful legal cases were brought against    five tribes,  Seminole Nation   Cherokee Nation, which have since granted citizenship  Freedmen descendants. But  that citizenship  implemented could come down  politics, said Jonathon Velie,  attorney  worked  behalf  Freedmen  both cases.

The roughly 2,500 Freedmen citizens   Seminole Nation   allowed    higher office    have access  certain resources, like tribal housing  education assistance. The 17,000 Freedmen citizens   Cherokee Nation, however, have been embraced   last  administrations   given  full benefits  tribal members.

When  comes   U.S. Department   Interior, which oversees many   resources owed  tribes through treaty rights,  Freedmen citizens  both tribes   same, said Velie — their tribes just honor their citizenship differently.

“I hope  (Muscogee) Creek Nation welcomes them back , because what they  today wasn’  U.S. Government   U.S. courts telling them, they told themselves  their  judicial system," Velie said.

WASHINGTON -- As  national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard  responsible  guarding America' secrets  discovering threats from overseas. But when  made  surprise appearance   White House briefing room Wednesday,  targets were President Donald Trump’ political enemies.

Escalating  attempts  undermine  long-settled conclusion that Russia tried  help Trump beat Hillary Clinton   presidency nearly  decade ,  unspooled what  called unshakable proof that then-President Barack Obama   advisers plotted nothing short   coup.

“They conspired  subvert  will   American people,”  said, claiming they fabricated evidence  taint Trump’ victory.

Little  what  said  ,  much    baseless. Gabbard said  investigation into  former Democratic administration  designed  stop  weaponization  national security institutions,   spurred more questions about   independence atop  spying system intended  provide unvarnished intelligence.

Gabbard,  former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii    president herself before joining Trump’ idiosyncratic political ecosystem, seemed prepared    presentation  burnish   standing. She  trailed   cinematographer husband,  held  video camera  capture  moment.

And Trump,   previously expressed public doubts about Gabbard’ analysis  Iran’ nuclear program, appeared satisfied. He posted  video   remarks, pinning them      social media feed.

It   display that cemented Gabbard’ role    Trump’ chief agents  retribution, delivering official recognition  Trump’ grievances about  Russia investigation that shadowed  first term. The focus   years- scandal also served Trump’ attempts  shift attention from  Jeffrey Epstein case  questions about  president’  association with  abuser  underage girls.

During  White House remarks, Gabbard said   referred  documents   Justice Department  consider   possible criminal investigation. Hours later,  department announced  creation   “strike force”  investigate  findings.

Obama’ postpresidential office declined  comment Wednesday  issued  rare response   earlier. “These bizarre allegations  ridiculous   weak attempt  distraction,” said Patrick Rodenbush,  Obama spokesman.

The White House rejected questions about  timing  Gabbard’ revelations  whether they were designed  curry favor with Trump  distract attention from  administration’ handling  files relating  Epstein.

Still, Trump  quick  reward Gabbard’ loyalty this week, calling  “ hottest person   room.”

On Wednesday,  released  report   Republican staff   House Intelligence Committee produced during  first Trump administration. It   dispute that Russia interfered   2016 election,  cites what  says were trade craft failings   assessment reached   intelligence community that Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced  election because  intended  Trump  .

Gabbard went beyond some conclusions   report  describing  findings from  White House podium. She, along with  report, also seized   fact that  dossier including uncorroborated tips  salacious gossip about Trump’ ties  Russia  referenced   classified version annex   intelligence community assessment released  2017 that detailed Russia’ interference.

The dossier    basis   FBI’ decision  open  investigation  July 2016 into potential coordination between  Trump campaign  Russia,  Trump supporters have seized   unverified innuendo   document    undercut  broader probe.

Gabbard said  didn' know   documents weren' released during Trump' first administration. Her office   respond  questions about  timing   release.

Responding   question from  reporter about Gabbard' motivations, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused journalists  looking   story where there wasn' .

“The only people   suggesting that  would release evidence  boost  standing   people  this room,” Leavitt said.

Trump, however,  said  wants  media,   public,  focus  Gabbard' report    ties  Epstein.

“We caught Hillary Clinton. We caught Barack Hussein Obama ...  ought take  look  that  stop talking about nonsense,” Trump said Tuesday.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe served briefly  director  national intelligence during Trump' first term    release    information declassified  Gabbard. The CIA declined  comment  Gabbard' remarks Wednesday.

Gabbard told Congress  April that Iran wasn’ actively seeking  nuclear weapon,  Trump dismissed  assessment just before U.S. strikes  Iran.

“I ’ care what  said,” Trump said  June  Air Force One when asked about Gabbard’ testimony.

Gabbard recently shared  findings about  Russia investigation   Oval Office meeting with Trump, according   administration officials  requested anonymity  discuss  private conversation. Afterward,    officials said, Trump expressed satisfaction that Gabbard’ findings aligned with   beliefs.

On Friday, Gabbard’ office released  report that downplayed  extent  Russian interference   2016 election  highlighting Obama administration emails showing officials  concluded before  after  presidential race that Moscow   hacked state election systems  manipulate votes  Trump’ favor.

But Obama’ Democratic administration never suggested otherwise, even   exposed other means  which Russia interfered   election, including through  massive hack--leak operation  Democratic emails  intelligence operatives working with WikiLeaks,  well   covert influence campaign aimed  swaying public opinion  sowing discord through fake social media posts.

Earlier this month Ratcliffe released  report criticizing aspects   intelligence community assessment  suggesting  process  been rushed. The report   address multiple investigations since then, including  report from  Republican- Senate Intelligence Committee  2020 that reached  same conclusion about Russia’ influence  motives.

Lawmakers from both parties have long stressed  need   independent intelligence service. Democrats said Gabbard’ reports show   placed partisanship  loyalty  Trump over  duty  some have called   resignation.

“It seems  though  Trump administration  willing  declassify anything  everything except  Epstein files,” Sen. Mark Warner  Virginia,  ranking Democrat   Senate Intelligence Committee, said   statement Wednesday.

Warner predicted Gabbard' actions could prompt U.S. allies  share less information  fear  would  politicized  recklessly declassified.

But Gabbard enjoys strong support among Republicans. Rep. Rick Crawford, chairman   House Intelligence Committee, said   Ratcliffe were working    intelligence community “  path  regaining  trust   American people.”

Rep. Jim Himes,   Democrat   House Intelligence panel, said Gabbard hasn' offered  reason  ignore  many earlier investigations into Russia' efforts.

“The Director  free  disagree with  Intelligence Community Assessment’ conclusion that Putin favored Donald Trump,   view stands  stark contrast   verdict rendered  multiple credible investigations,” Himes said   statement. “Including  bipartisan report released   Senate Intelligence Committee.”

Far beyond Harvard University   standoff with  Trump administration, Republican officials  several states have been pushing  changes  public universities

Ken Beckley never went  Harvard,    been wearing  crimson Harvard    show  solidarity. As  sees ,  Trump administration' attacks   school echo  case  government overreach    alma mater, Indiana University.

Beckley,  former head   school' alumni association, rallied fellow graduates this spring   unsuccessful effort  stop Gov. Mike Braun,  Republican, from removing three alumni-elected members from Indiana University’ Board  Trustees  handpicking their replacements.

No government effort  influence  university — private  public —  gotten more attention than  clash  Harvard, where  Trump administration  frozen billions  dollars  federal funding   seeks  series  policy changes. But  beyond  Ivy League, Republican officials  targeting public universities  several states with efforts seeking similar ends.

“What’ happened nationally   affecting Indiana,” said Beckley,  bought Harvard caps  bulk  passes them   friends.

Officials  conservative states took   higher education before President Donald Trump began  second term, driven  part   belief that colleges    touch —  liberal  loading  students with  much debt. The first efforts focused  critical race theory,  academic framework centered   idea that racism  embedded   nation’ institutions,  then  diversity, equity  inclusion programs.

Since Trump took office, officials  states including Indiana, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Iowa  Idaho increasingly have focused  university governance — rules   picks university presidents  boards   much control they exert over curriculums  faculty tenure.

As  Harvard, which Trump  decried  overly influenced  liberal thinking, those state officials have sought  reduce  power  faculty members  students.

“They’ realized that they  take     step further, that they  advance their policy priorities through those levers they have through  state university system,” said Preston Cooper,  senior fellow  studies higher education policy   conservative American Enterprise Institute.

In Indiana, Braun said  picked  trustees  will guide  school “back   right direction.” They include  anti-abortion attorney   former ESPN host   disciplined because  criticized  company' policy requiring employees   vaccinated against COVID-19.

Braun' administration  ramped  scrutiny  hiring practices  colleges statewide. Indiana' attorney general, Todd Rokita,  sent letters   University  Notre Dame, Butler University  DePauw University questioning  legality  their DEI programs.

Butler,  private, liberal arts school  Indianapolis,  founded   abolitionist   decade leading    Civil War  admitted women  students  color from  start.

“I hope that Butler will uphold  standards they were founded ,” said Edyn Curry, president  Butler’ Black Student Union.

In Florida,  state university system board  June rejected longtime academic Santa Ono   presidency   University  Florida, despite  unanimous vote  approval   school'  Board  Trustees. The unprecedented reversal followed criticism from conservatives about Ono' past support  DEI programs.

That followed  conservative makeover  New College  Florida,  small liberal arts school once known   state’ most progressive. After Republican Gov.

Historically,  Iowa board  been focused  -picture issues like setting tuition rates  approving degree programs. Now, there'  perceived sense that faculty should   solely responsible  academic matters  that  trustees should play  more active role, said Joseph Yockey,  professor   University  Iowa College  Law   former president  Iowa’ faculty senate.

“What  started   more recently  trustees losing confidence,” Yockey said.

As artificial intelligence technology becomes part  daily life, adolescents  turning  chatbots  advice, guidance  conversation. The appeal  clear: Chatbots  patient, never judgmental, supportive  always available.

That worries experts    booming AI industry  largely unregulated  that many parents have  idea about  their kids  using AI tools   extent  personal information they  sharing with chatbots.

New research shows more than 70%  American teenagers have used AI companions  more than half converse with them regularly. The study  Common Sense Media focused  “AI companions,” like Character. AI, Nomi  Replika, which  defines  “digital friends  characters   text  talk with whenever  want,” versus AI assistants  tools like ChatGPT, though  notes they   used  same .

It’ important that parents understand  technology. Experts suggest some things parents    help protect their kids:

— Start  conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher  Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity  basic questions: “Have  heard  AI companions?” “Do   apps that talk   like  friend?” Listen  understand what appeals  your teen before being dismissive  saying ’ worried about .

— Help teens recognize that AI companions  programmed   agreeable  validating. Explain that’   real relationships work  that real friends with their  points  view  help navigate difficult situations  ways that AI companions cannot.

“One   things that' really concerning   only what' happening  screen   much time ’ taking kids away from relationships  real life,” says Mitch Prinstein, chief  psychology   American Psychological Association. “We need  teach kids that this   form  entertainment. It'  real,  ' really important they distinguish  from reality  should  have  replace relationships  your actual life.”

The APA recently    health advisory  AI  adolescent well-being,  tips  parents.

— Parents should watch  signs  unhealthy attachments.

“If your teen  preferring AI interactions over real relationships  spending hours talking  AI companions,  showing that they  becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them — those  patterns that suggest AI companions might  replacing rather than complementing human connection,” Robb says.

— Parents   rules about AI , just like they   screen time  social media. Have discussions about when   AI tools   cannot  used. Many AI companions  designed  adult    mimic romantic, intimate  role-playing scenarios.

While AI companions  feel supportive, children should understand  tools   equipped  handle  real crisis  provide genuine mental health support. If kids  struggling with depression, anxiety, loneliness,  eating disorder  other mental health challenges, they need human support — whether   family, friends   mental health professional.

— Get informed. The more parents know about AI,  better. “I ' think people quite  what AI  ,  many teens  using    ' starting    little scary,” says Prinstein,   many experts calling  regulations  ensure safety guardrails  children. “A    throw  hands   , ‘I ’ know what this !' This sounds crazy!' Unfortunately, that tells kids   have  problem with this, ' come   because I  going  diminish   belittle .”

Older teenagers have advice, ,  parents  kids. Banning AI tools    solution because  technology  becoming ubiquitous, says Ganesh Nair, 18.

“Trying    AI  like trying    social media today. It   ingrained  everything  ,” says Nair,   trying  step back from using AI companions after seeing them affect real-life friendships   high school. “The best      regulate    embrace being challenged.”

“Anything that  difficult, AI  make easy. But that   problem,” says Nair. “Actively seek  challenges, whether academic  personal. If  fall   idea that easier  better, then    most vulnerable  being absorbed into this newly artificial world.”

In 2008, Epstein   deal with federal prosecutors  Florida that allowed   escape more severe federal charges  instead plead guilty  state charges  procuring  person under 18  prostitution  solicitation  prostitution.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  asked judges  Florida  New York  unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings that resulted  indictments against Epstein  former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, saying “transparency   American public    utmost importance  this Administration.”

Federal grand juries hear evidence  secret  then decide whether there  enough   indictment. Experts   transcripts likely would  reveal much because prosecutors typically  trying only  present enough material   charges  ' introduce  entire investigation.

Epstein,  wealthy financier, years later  arrested  2019  federal  trafficking charges, while Maxwell  charged with helping  abuse teenage girls.

Epstein  found dead   cell   federal jail  New York City about  month after   arrested. Investigators concluded  killed himself. Maxwell later  convicted  trial  sentenced  20 years  prison.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump’ choice  ambassador  Buenos Aires sparked  storm Wednesday over  remarks that Argentina' powerful -president should face justice  cases  which   never convicted   pledges    posting   bulwark against China.

Opposition politicians  Argentina accused Peter Lamelas, Trump’ nominee  ambassador   second-biggest South American country,  violating diplomatic conventions, interfering  Argentine domestic affairs  meddling  judicial matters.

Argentine media went into fifth gear with their coverage  Lamelas. Lawmakers introduced  bill  Congress rejecting  remarks  “ unacceptable interference  matters  national sovereignty.” Trade unions planned  mass protest  Thursday outside  U.S. Embassy  Buenos Aires.

The Cuban-born Lamelas,  physician, founder   chain  urgent care clinics  Florida  longtime Trump donor, would otherwise  stepping into  role   time when  relationship between Argentina   United States    strongest  recent memory.

Lamelas spoke  Tuesday before  Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing   nomination.

He said  would support Trump’ ally, right-wing Argentine President Javier Milei,  ensuring that  country' former president Cristina Fernández  Kirchner —  serving  -year sentence  corruption charges under house arrest — gets  “ justice that  well deserves"  cases unrelated   current sentence.

He also claimed  house arrest   result  “political favoritism,” although   common practice  Argentina  those convicted over    70.

Fernández,  most prominent figure  Argentina’ left-leaning Peronist opposition movement, which holds  majority  Congress,   mince words when  posted  reaction.

“The only thing  didn’   that ’ appoint  courts himself,”  said. Referencing scandals roiling  U.S., such including  investigation  convicted  offender Jeffrey Epstein,  added: “They should clean their  house before commenting  ours.”

There   immediate comment   hearing from libertarian Milei, elected  2023   wave  public outrage over  failed economic policies  Fernández  other left-leaning populist predecessors.

Milei  repeatedly praised Trump  replicated  policies — including  following  U.S.  pulling Argentina from The World Health Organization —  recently dined  posed  friendly photos with Lamelas  Trump’ opulent Mar--Lago club.

“LAMELAS GO HOME,” wrote Axel Kicillof,  governor  Buenos Aires, Argentina’ most populous province,  X.

“Lamelas’ statements evoke  darkest times  United States interference   democratic life   region,”  added.

Lamelas waded into  controversy Tuesday when remarking   alleged role  Fernández, Milei' political enemy,   cover-  obstruct  investigation into  1994 bombing   Jewish community center  Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people  wounded more than 300.

While several people, including  former federal judge   former head   intelligence services, have been convicted  helping  stymie  investigation into  attack, Fernández    stand trial  cover- charges. She denies  allegations.

In  testimony, Lamelas contended that Fernández  “definitely involved   cover-," without elaborating  saying   believes this.

As ambassador,  would support “Milei   Milei government   their efforts     bottom”   bombing  "make sure that Cristina Fernández  Kirchner receives  justice that  well deserves,” Lamelas said.

Fueling  fire further,  suggested Fernández  something   with  suspicious 2015 death  Alberto Nisman,  special prosecutor appointed  investigate  bombing.

“God knows    involved  () death,” Lamelas said.

Fernández   been formally accused  charged  connection with Nisman’ death. An early investigation stated that Nisman committed suicide,   later report showed that    homicide. The case   been resolved.

In another part   testimony, Lamelas expressed concern over China’ growing influence  Argentina, citing that  governors  Argentina’ 23 provinces   autonomy  negotiate “with external forces, with  Chinese  others,  come    projects  those particular provinces."

“That  also lend toward corruption,”  added. “My role     into  countryside  make sure that  weed  corruption."

Argentina' provincial governors castigated Lamelas  called  Milei  reject  nomination.

“Stay  your country  solve your (country') corruption problems,” shot back Gustavo Melella, governor  Argentina' southernmost Tierra  Fuego province. "No ambassador   right  lecture .”

The governor  Argentina' central La Pampa province, Sergio Ziliotto,   similar response: “The only ones   command    people  La Pampa.”

Despite U.S. efforts  urge  Milei administration — along with other U.S. allies  Latin America —  move away from China, Argentina' trade with China  increased over  past year.

China' Embassy  Argentina issued  statement apparently directed  Lamelas, though    mention .

“Argentina should  become  stage   games  major powers,"  said.

LONDON -- Britain’ Supreme Court  Wednesday quashed  convictions   financial market traders accused  manipulating benchmark interest rates     biggest scandals  come    global financial crisis  2008.

The charges against Tom Hayes,  former Citigroup  UBS trader,  Carlo Palombo,  worked  Barclays, centered around alleged efforts  influence  London Inter-Bank Offered Rate,  Libor,   euro currency equivalent Euribor, which were used    interest rates  trillions  dollars  loans  other financial products around  world.

The court ruled that  convictions  Hayes  Palombo were unfair because  judges  their separate cases gave inaccurate instructions  jurors. That effectively prevented jurors from considering   question  whether  traders  acted dishonestly.

“That misdirection undermined  fairness   trial,” Judge George Leggatt wrote   82-page decision backed   five members   panel that heard  case.

Hayes  convicted  August 2015  sentenced   maximum  14 years  prison, which  later reduced  11 years. Palombo, convicted  March 2019,  sentenced  four years  prison. Both  were released  2021.

“It destroyed  family, I missed most   ’ childhood,” Hayes told  BBC.

“For  long I’ been  international fugitive …   I  move  with  life,   ,”  added.

The decision came after  U.S. Second Circuit Court  Appeal  2022 overturned  convictions   traders charged with similar crimes   United States. Hayes  Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected  British judges, were allowed  take their case   U.K. Supreme Court after that ruling.

The U.K.’ Serious Fraud Office began investigating alleged efforts  manipulate Libor  2012. That ultimately    conviction  nine bankers.

“We have considered this judgment   full circumstances carefully  determined  would     public interest    seek  retrial,”  SFO said  response   Supreme Court ruling.

Libor  Euribor were critical benchmarks that were once used    interest rates  everything from business loans  home mortgages  credit card debts. As  result, they also became central  more complex financial transactions such  those used  banks  businesses    interest rate fluctuations.

The benchmarks were vulnerable  manipulation because they were   banks that could profit from swings  interest rates.

Each , major international banks were asked  submit  interest rate  which they could borrow money from other banks. An average  those submissions  then used    daily Libor  Euribor rates.

During  financial crisis, regulators became aware that some banks were making artificially  Libor submissions  make their institutions seem more creditworthy. Some traders also sought  influence  submissions made  their banks  even small moves   benchmark rates could boost their profits.

Those risks became even more pronounced during  financial crisis, when lending dried   bankers   base their daily submissions   subjective assessment   market rather than actual loans.

Libor  Euribor were phased   recent years,  part because they were seen  worsening  financial crisis.

For  hours every  after school, Nahideh works   cemetery, collecting water from  nearby shrine  sell  mourners visiting loved ones’ graves

KABUL, Afghanistan -- For  hours every  after school, Nahideh works   cemetery, collecting water from  nearby shrine  sell  mourners visiting loved ones’ graves. She dreams  becoming  doctor —  knows    futile dream.

When  next school year starts,  will  enrolling   madrassa,  religious school,  learn about  Quran  Islam —  little else.

“I prefer    school,  I ’,  I will    madrassa,”  said, dark brown eyes peering  from beneath  tightly wrapped black headscarf. “If I could   school then I could learn  become  doctor. But I ’.”

At    13, Nahideh    last grade  primary school,  limit  education allowed  girls  Afghanistan. The country’ Taliban government banned girls from secondary school  university three years  —  only country   world   . The   part  myriad restrictions  women  girls, dictating everything from what they  wear  where they     they   with.

With  option  higher education, many girls  women  turning  madrassas instead.

“Since  schools  closed  girls, they  this   opportunity,” said Zahid--Rehman Sahibi, director   Tasnim Nasrat Islamic Sciences Educational Center  Kabul. “So, they come here  stay engaged  learning  studying religious sciences.”

The center’ roughly 400 students range  ages from about 3  60,  90%  female. They study  Quran, Islamic jurisprudence,  sayings   Prophet Muhammad,  Arabic,  language   Quran.

Most Afghans, Sahibi noted,  religious. “Even before  schools were closed, many used  attend madrassas,”  said. “But after  closure  schools,  interest  increased significantly, because  doors   madrassas remain open  them.”

No recent official figures  available   number  girls enrolled  madrassas,  officials   popularity  religious schools overall  been growing. Last September, Deputy Minister  Education Karamatullah Akhundzada said  least 1 million students  enrolled  madrassas over  past year alone, bringing  total  over 3 million.

Sheltered from  heat   early summer’    basement room   Tasnim Nasrat center, Sahibi’ students knelt  small plastic tables   carpeted floor, their pencils tracing lines  Arabic script  their Qurans. All 10 young women wore black niqabs,  -encompassing garment that includes  veil, leaving only  eyes visible.

“It  very good  girls  women  study   madrassa, because …  Quran   word  Allah,    Muslims,” said 25-year- Faiza,   enrolled   center five months earlier. “Therefore,    duty  know what    book that Allah  revealed  ,  understand  interpretation  translation.”

“When  family sees that I  learning Quranic sciences  that I  practicing   teachings   Quran   life,  they  assured  this, they will definitely allow   continue  studies,”  said.

Her teacher said ’ prefer  women were  strictly limited  religious studies.

“In  opinion,   very important   sister   woman  learn both religious sciences  other subjects, because modern knowledge  also  important part  society,” Sahibi said. “Islam also recommends that modern sciences should  learned because they  necessary,  religious sciences  important alongside them. Both should  learned simultaneously.”

The female secondary  higher education   been controversial  Afghanistan, even within  ranks   Taliban itself. In  rare sign  open dissent, Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Abbas Stanikzai said   public speech  January that there   justification  denying education  girls  women.

His remarks were reportedly  well tolerated   Taliban leadership; Stanikzai   officially  leave   believed  have left  country. But they were  clear indication that many  Afghanistan recognize  long-term impact  denying education  girls.

“If this  persists until 2030, over four million girls will have been deprived  their right  education beyond primary school,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said   statement   start  Afghanistan’  school year  March. “The consequences  these girls —   Afghanistan —  catastrophic. The  negatively impacts  health system,  economy,   future   nation.”

For some  this deeply conservative society,  teachings  Islam  hard  overstate.

“Learning  Holy Quran   foundation   other sciences, whether ’ medicine, engineering,  other fields  knowledge,” said Mullah Mohammed Jan Mukhtar, 35,  runs  boys’ madrassa north  Kabul. “If someone first learns  Quran, they will then  able  learn these other sciences much better.”

“Rediscovering    endemics  many levels  significant,” said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer  Re:wild  helped rediscover  snake along with Blades. “It reminds  that  still have something important left that plays  important role   ecosystem.”

The Barbados threadsnake  only been seen  handful  times since 1889. It    list  4,800 plant, animal  fungi species that Re:wild described  “lost  science.”

The snake  blind, burrows   ground, eats termites  ants  lays  single, slender . Fully grown,  measures   four inches (10 centimeters).

“They’ very cryptic,” Blades said. “You    survey   number  hours,  even  they  there,   actually   them.”

But  March 20  around 10:30 .., Blades  Springer surrounded  jack--- tree  central Barbados  started looking under rocks while  rest   team began measuring  tree, whose distribution  very limited  Barbados.

“That’   story   exciting,” Springer said. “It  happened around  same time.”

S. Blair Hedges,  professor  Temple University  director   center  biology,   first  identify  Barbados threadsnake. Previously,   mistakenly lumped  with another species.

In 2008, Hedges’ discovery  published   scientific journal, with  snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae,  honor   wife.

“I spent days searching  them,” Hedges recalled. “Based   observations   hundreds  rocks, objects that I turned over looking  this thing without success, I  think    rare species.”

That  June 2006,  there were only three other such specimens known   time:    London museum   third   museum collection  California that  wrongly identified  being from Antigua instead  Barbados, Hedges said.

Hedges said that  didn’ realize   collected   species until    genetic analysis.

“The  moment    laboratory,”  said, noting that  discovery established  Barbados threadsnake   world’ smallest-known snake.

Hedges then became inundated  years with letters, photographs  emails from people thinking they  found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some   pictures were  earthworms,  recalled.

“It  literally years  distraction,”  said.

Scientists hope  rediscovery means that  Barbados threadsnake could become  champion   protection  wildlife habitat.

A   endemic species   tiny island have gone extinct, including  Barbados racer,  Barbados skink   particular species  cave shrimp.

“I hope they   some interest  protecting ,” Hedges said. “Barbados  kind  unique   Caribbean    reason:    least amount  original forest, outside  Haiti.”

Australia  reduce US beef import restrictions denounced  Trump   

MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) —

Australia will reduce restrictions  U.S. beef imports after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized what  described   Australian    meat, Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said.

Collins said Thursday that relaxing  restrictions designed  keep Australia free    disease, also known  bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE, among  cattle herds would  compromise biosecurity.

“Australia stands  open  free trade —  cattle industry  significantly benefited from this,” Collins said   statement.

Australia  allowed imports  beef grown   United States since 2019. But Australia   allowed imports from  U.S.  beef sourced from Canada  Mexico because   disease risk.

But  U.S.  recently introduced additional movement controls that identify  trace  cattle from Mexico  Canada  their farms  origin.

Australian authorities were “satisfied  strengthened control measures   place   U.S. effectively manage biosecurity risks,” Collins said.

The timing   , reduced restrictions   been finalized.

Trump attacked Australian import restrictions  U.S. beef when  announced  April that tariffs   least 10% would  placed  Australian imports, with steel  aluminum facing  50% tariff.

“Australia bans —  they’ wonderful people,  wonderful everything —  they  American beef,” Trump told reporters then.

“Yet  imported $3 billion  Australian beef from them just last year alone. They ’ take    beef. They ’ want  because they ’ want   affect their farmers ,  know, I ’ blame them,  ’ doing  same thing right ,” Trump added.

Opposition lawmaker David Littleproud suspected  government  endangering Australia’ cattle industry  appease Trump.

“I want    science   should  predicated  science. I’ suspicious   speed  which this  been done,” Littleproud told reporters.

“We need  give confidence   industry,  also   ( public): this   just about animal welfare, this  about human welfare, this  about BSE potentially coming into this country  having  human impact,  I think ’ important  government’ very transparent about  science  I ’ think ’ even beyond  question  have  independent panel review that science  give confidence  everybody,”  added.

Around 70%  Australian beef  exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight  diseases including    foot--mouth disease infected Australian cattle.

Will Evans, chief executive  Cattle Australia  represents more than 52,000 grass- beef producers across  nation, said   confident  agriculture department  taken  cautious approach toward U.S. imports.

“The department’ undertaken  technical scientific assessment   have   faith  them. They’ made this assessment themselves. They’ said: ‘We’ looked  this, ’ looked   best science, this   decision that  feel comfortable with,’” Evans told  Australian Broadcasting Corp.

“When  have  75 billion (Australian dollar, $50 billion) industry relying  them  making this mistake, I’ sure they’ been very cautious  their decision-making,”  added.

Beef prices have been rising   U.S.   factors that include drought  shrinking domestic herd numbers.

The average price   pound  ground beef   U.S. rose  $6.12  June,  nearly 12% from  year , according  U.S. government data. The average price   uncooked beef steaks rose 8%  $11.49  pound.

Far beyond Harvard University   standoff with  Trump administration, Republican officials  several states have been pushing  changes  public universities

Ken Beckley never went  Harvard,    been wearing  crimson Harvard    show  solidarity. As  sees ,  Trump administration' attacks   school echo  case  government overreach    alma mater, Indiana University.

Beckley,  former head   school' alumni association, rallied fellow graduates this spring   unsuccessful effort  stop Gov. Mike Braun,  Republican, from removing three alumni-elected members from Indiana University’ Board  Trustees  handpicking their replacements.

No government effort  influence  university — private  public —  gotten more attention than  clash  Harvard, where  Trump administration  frozen billions  dollars  federal funding   seeks  series  policy changes. But  beyond  Ivy League, Republican officials  targeting public universities  several states with efforts seeking similar ends.

“What’ happened nationally   affecting Indiana,” said Beckley,  bought Harvard caps  bulk  passes them   friends.

Officials  conservative states took   higher education before President Donald Trump began  second term, driven  part   belief that colleges    touch —  liberal  loading  students with  much debt. The first efforts focused  critical race theory,  academic framework centered   idea that racism  embedded   nation’ institutions,  then  diversity, equity  inclusion programs.

Since Trump took office, officials  states including Indiana, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Iowa  Idaho increasingly have focused  university governance — rules   picks university presidents  boards   much control they exert over curriculums  faculty tenure.

As  Harvard, which Trump  decried  overly influenced  liberal thinking, those state officials have sought  reduce  power  faculty members  students.

“They’ realized that they  take     step further, that they  advance their policy priorities through those levers they have through  state university system,” said Preston Cooper,  senior fellow  studies higher education policy   conservative American Enterprise Institute.

In Indiana, Braun said  picked  trustees  will guide  school “back   right direction.” They include  anti-abortion attorney   former ESPN host   disciplined because  criticized  company' policy requiring employees   vaccinated against COVID-19.

Braun' administration  ramped  scrutiny  hiring practices  colleges statewide. Indiana' attorney general, Todd Rokita,  sent letters   University  Notre Dame, Butler University  DePauw University questioning  legality  their DEI programs.

Butler,  private, liberal arts school  Indianapolis,  founded   abolitionist   decade leading    Civil War  admitted women  students  color from  start.

“I hope that Butler will uphold  standards they were founded ,” said Edyn Curry, president  Butler’ Black Student Union.

In Florida,  state university system board  June rejected longtime academic Santa Ono   presidency   University  Florida, despite  unanimous vote  approval   school'  Board  Trustees. The unprecedented reversal followed criticism from conservatives about Ono' past support  DEI programs.

That followed  conservative makeover  New College  Florida,  small liberal arts school once known   state’ most progressive. After Republican Gov.

Historically,  Iowa board  been focused  -picture issues like setting tuition rates  approving degree programs. Now, there'  perceived sense that faculty should   solely responsible  academic matters  that  trustees should play  more active role, said Joseph Yockey,  professor   University  Iowa College  Law   former president  Iowa’ faculty senate.

“What  started   more recently  trustees losing confidence,” Yockey said.

WASHINGTON -- As  national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard  responsible  guarding America' secrets  discovering threats from overseas. But when  made  surprise appearance   White House briefing room Wednesday,  targets were President Donald Trump’ political enemies.

Escalating  attempts  undermine  long-settled conclusion that Russia tried  help Trump beat Hillary Clinton   presidency nearly  decade ,  unspooled what  called unshakable proof that then-President Barack Obama   advisers plotted nothing short   coup.

“They conspired  subvert  will   American people,”  said, claiming they fabricated evidence  taint Trump’ victory.

Little  what  said  ,  much    baseless. Gabbard said  investigation into  former Democratic administration  designed  stop  weaponization  national security institutions,   spurred more questions about   independence atop  spying system intended  provide unvarnished intelligence.

Gabbard,  former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii    president herself before joining Trump’ idiosyncratic political ecosystem, seemed prepared    presentation  burnish   standing. She  trailed   cinematographer husband,  held  video camera  capture  moment.

And Trump,   previously expressed public doubts about Gabbard’ analysis  Iran’ nuclear program, appeared satisfied. He posted  video   remarks, pinning them      social media feed.

It   display that cemented Gabbard’ role    Trump’ chief agents  retribution, delivering official recognition  Trump’ grievances about  Russia investigation that shadowed  first term. The focus   years- scandal also served Trump’ attempts  shift attention from  Jeffrey Epstein case  questions about  president’  association with  abuser  underage girls.

During  White House remarks, Gabbard said   referred  documents   Justice Department  consider   possible criminal investigation. Hours later,  department announced  creation   “strike force”  investigate  findings.

Obama’ postpresidential office declined  comment Wednesday  issued  rare response   earlier. “These bizarre allegations  ridiculous   weak attempt  distraction,” said Patrick Rodenbush,  Obama spokesman.

The White House rejected questions about  timing  Gabbard’ revelations  whether they were designed  curry favor with Trump  distract attention from  administration’ handling  files relating  Epstein.

Still, Trump  quick  reward Gabbard’ loyalty this week, calling  “ hottest person   room.”

On Wednesday,  released  report   Republican staff   House Intelligence Committee produced during  first Trump administration. It   dispute that Russia interfered   2016 election,  cites what  says were trade craft failings   assessment reached   intelligence community that Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced  election because  intended  Trump  .

Gabbard went beyond some conclusions   report  describing  findings from  White House podium. She, along with  report, also seized   fact that  dossier including uncorroborated tips  salacious gossip about Trump’ ties  Russia  referenced   classified version annex   intelligence community assessment released  2017 that detailed Russia’ interference.

The dossier    basis   FBI’ decision  open  investigation  July 2016 into potential coordination between  Trump campaign  Russia,  Trump supporters have seized   unverified innuendo   document    undercut  broader probe.

Gabbard said  didn' know   documents weren' released during Trump' first administration. Her office   respond  questions about  timing   release.

Responding   question from  reporter about Gabbard' motivations, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused journalists  looking   story where there wasn' .

“The only people   suggesting that  would release evidence  boost  standing   people  this room,” Leavitt said.

Trump, however,  said  wants  media,   public,  focus  Gabbard' report    ties  Epstein.

“We caught Hillary Clinton. We caught Barack Hussein Obama ...  ought take  look  that  stop talking about nonsense,” Trump said Tuesday.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe served briefly  director  national intelligence during Trump' first term    release    information declassified  Gabbard. The CIA declined  comment  Gabbard' remarks Wednesday.

Gabbard told Congress  April that Iran wasn’ actively seeking  nuclear weapon,  Trump dismissed  assessment just before U.S. strikes  Iran.

“I ’ care what  said,” Trump said  June  Air Force One when asked about Gabbard’ testimony.

Gabbard recently shared  findings about  Russia investigation   Oval Office meeting with Trump, according   administration officials  requested anonymity  discuss  private conversation. Afterward,    officials said, Trump expressed satisfaction that Gabbard’ findings aligned with   beliefs.

On Friday, Gabbard’ office released  report that downplayed  extent  Russian interference   2016 election  highlighting Obama administration emails showing officials  concluded before  after  presidential race that Moscow   hacked state election systems  manipulate votes  Trump’ favor.

But Obama’ Democratic administration never suggested otherwise, even   exposed other means  which Russia interfered   election, including through  massive hack--leak operation  Democratic emails  intelligence operatives working with WikiLeaks,  well   covert influence campaign aimed  swaying public opinion  sowing discord through fake social media posts.

Earlier this month Ratcliffe released  report criticizing aspects   intelligence community assessment  suggesting  process  been rushed. The report   address multiple investigations since then, including  report from  Republican- Senate Intelligence Committee  2020 that reached  same conclusion about Russia’ influence  motives.

Lawmakers from both parties have long stressed  need   independent intelligence service. Democrats said Gabbard’ reports show   placed partisanship  loyalty  Trump over  duty  some have called   resignation.

“It seems  though  Trump administration  willing  declassify anything  everything except  Epstein files,” Sen. Mark Warner  Virginia,  ranking Democrat   Senate Intelligence Committee, said   statement Wednesday.

Warner predicted Gabbard' actions could prompt U.S. allies  share less information  fear  would  politicized  recklessly declassified.

But Gabbard enjoys strong support among Republicans. Rep. Rick Crawford, chairman   House Intelligence Committee, said   Ratcliffe were working    intelligence community “  path  regaining  trust   American people.”

Rep. Jim Himes,   Democrat   House Intelligence panel, said Gabbard hasn' offered  reason  ignore  many earlier investigations into Russia' efforts.

“The Director  free  disagree with  Intelligence Community Assessment’ conclusion that Putin favored Donald Trump,   view stands  stark contrast   verdict rendered  multiple credible investigations,” Himes said   statement. “Including  bipartisan report released   Senate Intelligence Committee.”

The 50-48 vote came after Democrats forced  additional procedural vote   nomination,  effort  protest  nomination  delay  process. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Bove “ extreme   extreme   extreme”  “Trump’ worst judicial nominee  date.”

“Mr. Bove’ entire career  been built   thing: fealty  Donald Trump,” Schumer said.

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski   only Republican  vote with Democrats against moving  consider  nomination. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted with Republicans  move forward  said   statement that  will oppose Bove’ confirmation   final vote.

“We have  have judges  will adhere   rule     Constitution    regardless  what their personal views  ,” Collins said. “Mr. Bove’ political profile  some   actions   taken   leadership roles   Department  Justice cause   conclude  would  serve   impartial jurist.”

It  unclear whether  other Republicans will oppose Bove’ confirmation. If  Democrats vote against  nomination, Senate Republicans  lose three GOP votes  still confirm   Vice President JD Vance breaks  50-50 .

BOSTON -- BOSTON (AP) —

Harvard University will appear  federal court Monday  make  case that  Trump administration illegally  $2.6 billion from  storied college —  pivotal moment   battle against  federal government.

If U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs decides   university' favor,  ruling would reverse  series  funding freezes that later became outright cuts   Trump administration escalated  fight with  nation’ oldest  wealthiest university. Such  ruling,   stands, would revive Harvard’ sprawling scientific  medical research operation  hundreds  projects that lost federal money.

“This case involves  Government’ efforts    withholding  federal funding  leverage  gain control  academic decisionmaking  Harvard,”  university said   complaint. “All told,  tradeoff   Harvard  other universities  clear: Allow  Government  micromanage your academic institution  jeopardize  institution’ ability  pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries,  innovative solutions.”

A second lawsuit over  cuts filed   American Association  University Professors   Harvard faculty chapter  been consolidated with  university'.

Harvard’ lawsuit accuses President Donald Trump' administration  waging  retaliation campaign against  university after  rejected  series  demands   April 11 letter from  federal antisemitism task force.

The letter demanded sweeping changes related  campus protests, academics  admissions. For example,  letter told Harvard  audit  viewpoints  students  faculty  admit more students  hire  professors   campus  found  lack diverse points  view. The letter  meant  address government accusations that  university  become  hotbed  liberalism  tolerated anti-Jewish harassment  campus.

Harvard President Alan Garber pledged  fight antisemitism  said  government “should dictate what private universities  teach, whom they  admit  hire,  which areas  study  inquiry they  pursue.”

The same  Harvard rejected  demands, Trump officials moved  freeze $2.2 billion  research grants. Education Secretary Linda McMahon declared  May that Harvard would  longer  eligible   grants,  weeks later  administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.

As Harvard fought  funding freeze  court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that  frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited  clause that allows grants   scrapped  they  longer align with government policies.

Harvard, which   nation' largest endowment  $53 billion,  moved  self-fund some   research,  warned  ’ absorb  full cost   federal cuts.

In court filings,  school said  government “fails  explain   termination  funding  research  treat cancer, support veterans,  improve national security addresses antisemitism.”

The Trump administration denies  cuts were made  retaliation, saying  grants were under review even before  April demand letter  sent. It argues  government  wide discretion  cancel contracts  policy reasons.

“It   policy   United States under  Trump Administration   fund institutions that fail  adequately address antisemitism  their programs,”  said  court documents.

The research funding  only  front  Harvard’ fight with  federal government. The Trump administration also  sought  prevent  school from hosting foreign students,  Trump  threatened  revoke Harvard' -exempt status.

Finally, last month,  Trump administration formally issued  finding that  school tolerated antisemitism —  step that eventually could jeopardize   Harvard’ federal funding, including federal student loans  grants. The penalty  typically referred    “death sentence.”

At  Texas Capitol, Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows gaveled   30- session  appointed  committee  oversee what  already escalating into  contentious battle over  state’ voting maps. Democrats promised  fight  redraw  they  heavily outnumbered   Texas Legislature, leaving them with  paths  resistance.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott added redistricting   lengthy agenda  gave  lawmakers  ordering them back   Texas Capitol. That list includes addressing Texas' catastrophic floods that killed  least 135 people    Kerr County officials under scrutiny over  residents were  given more warning.

Abbott,  three-term governor, cited “constitutional concerns" brought   Justice Department  redrawing  maps, which  typically done once every 10 years.

Texas Democrats  2021 gridlocked  state Capitol  38 days  refusing  come  work  protest  proposed voting restrictions. When they returned,  measure passed.

Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton  threatened  arrest those  attempt  walk      $500   fines lawmakers face  breaking  quorum.

“While partisan activists focus solely  political issues, Governor Abbott  dedicated  delivering results  issues important  Texans, such  flood relief, property  cuts,   elimination   STAAR test,”  said, referring   standardized exam  Texas students.

There  some concerns that rigging    much, known  gerrymandering, could backfire  Republicans. If  many Democratic voters  sifted into Republican districts,  could make them more competitive than they otherwise would .

The state  also tangled  litigation with civil rights groups  allege  maps were racially gerrymandered  2021.

Texas currently holds 38 seats   House,  which 25  held  Republicans  12  Democrats, while  seat remains vacant from  late Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner  will  filled   special election later this year.

On Capitol Hill,  House Oversight Committee  convened hearings     autopen  Biden’ fitness  office. Van Orden cited  Constitution’ Article II vesting authority solely with  president.

“It doesn’  chief  staff. It doesn’   auto ,”  said.

The House panel subpoenaed Biden’ physician    aide  former first lady Jill Biden. Both invoked Fifth Amendment protections that prevent people from being forced  testify against themselves  government proceedings.

“There   there there,” said Democratic Rep. Wesley Bell  Missouri,  member   committee  called  effort “ extraordinary waste  time.”

The committee' chairman, Rep. James Comer, wants  hear from former White House chiefs  staff Ron Klain  Jeff Zients; former senior advisers Mike Donilon  Anita Dunn;  other former  aides Bruce Reed, Steve Ricchetti  Annie Tomasini, among others. Republicans confirmed multiple dates   sessions through late September, ensuring  will remain   headlines.

That GOP schedule comes  both parties work feverishly  define Trump’ start   second term.

His -called “One Big Beautiful Bill”      cuts, border security measures  cuts  safety  programs such  Medicaid,  joint state-federal insurance program  lower-income Americans. Polls suggest some individual measures  popular while others    that  GOP faces headwinds  tilting  public  favor   overall effort.

A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center  Public Affairs Research found that about -thirds  U.S. adults view  bill      wealthy  another found that only about -quarter  U.S. adults felt Trump’ policies have helped them. In  policy survey,  failed  earn majority support     major issues, including  economy, immigration, government spending  health care. Immigration, especially,  been considered  major strength  Trump politically.

It  “rather tone deaf,” said Rep. Wesley Bell,  Missouri Democrat,  Republicans   after Biden given those circumstances.

“Americans want   deal with  issues that  plaguing  country  …  high cost  living, cost  food,  cost  housing, health care,” Bell said,   blasted  GOP   deliberate “distraction" from what challenges most U.S. households.

The effort also comes with Trump battling   supporters over  Justice Department' decision   publicly release additional records related   Epstein case.

“The Epstein saga  more important   base than whatever happened  Joe Biden,” said Ayres,  GOP pollster.

Even Lalota,  New York congressman, acknowledged  balancing  with  Biden inquiries.

“My constituents care most about affordability  public safety,” Lalota said. “But this   important issue nonetheless.”

With Republicans protecting  narrow House majority, every hotly contested issue could  seen  determinative   2026 midterm elections.

That puts added pressure  Republicans  retain Trump’ expanded 2024 coalition, when  increased support among Black  Hispanic voters, especially , over  usual Republican levels. But that’ considerably harder without Trump himself   ballot. That could explain Republican efforts  keep going after Biden given  unpopular   with Trump’ core supporters.

Democrats, meanwhile, point  their success   2018 midterms during Trump’ first presidency, when they reclaimed  House majority   strength  moderate voters, including disaffected Republicans. They seem confident that Republicans’ aggressiveness about Biden does  appeal  that swath   electorate.

But even  they praise Biden’ accomplishments  president, Democrats quietly admit they ’ want  spend time talking about  figure  left office with lagging approval ratings  forced  party into  late, difficult change      ticket.

Democratic Rep. Don Beyer  Virginia said Biden  productive while acknowledging  "       game because   .” He said Democrats want  look forward, most immediately  trying   control   House  make gains   Senate.

“And then ’  standard bearer  2028?” Beyer said. "And    minimize  Trump damage with what  have right ?”

LOS ANGELES -- There  thousands  illegal marijuana farms around  country.

But when  federal government decided  stage    largest raids since President Donald Trump took office  January,  picked  biggest legal grower  California.

Nearly  weeks later,  reason   federal raid   Glass House farm sites northwest  Los Angeles remains unclear   prompted speculation. Some   raid  intended  send  chilling message  immigrants   U.S. illegally —  also  rattle  state’ legal cannabis industry.

Meanwhile,  Republican Trump administration  been feuding with heavily Democratic California over funding  everything from high-speed rail construction  wildfire relief,  ’ also possible Glass House  pulled into  broader conflict between  White House  Sacramento.

“There  plenty  other places they    find illegal workers,” said political consultant Adam Spiker,  advises cannabis companies. “A   people believe there   hint  politics  this. It’ federal enforcement coming into California   after cannabis.”

On July 10, U.S. Immigration  Customs Enforcement  Border Patrol agents executed  search warrant  Glass House’ farms  Carpinteria  Camarillo, court filings show.

At  Camarillo site, armored vehicles blocked  road, which  lined with fields  greenhouses,  masked agents deployed onto  property. One farmworker  fell from  greenhouse roof while running  hide later died from  injuries.

The operation came more than  month into  extended crackdown across Southern California that  originally centered  Los Angeles, where local officials   federal actions  spreading fear  immigrant communities.

After  raid, United Farm Workers —  country’ biggest farm worker union — posted  urgent message   social media accounts warning that because marijuana  illegal under federal , workers    U.S. citizens should avoid jobs   cannabis industry, including state-licensed facilities.

“We know this  unfair,”  said, “  encourage   protect yourself  your family.”

Industry experts point  unwelcome publicity  company received after rival Catalyst Cannabis Co. filed  2023 lawsuit alleging that Glass House “ become    largest,    largest, black marketers  cannabis   state  California.” The lawsuit, formally filed  Catalyst parent 562 Discount Med Inc.,  dismissed last year   headlines might have drawn  interest  federal investigators.

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump rehashed longstanding grievances over  Russia investigation that shadowed much   first term, lashing  Tuesday following   report from  intelligence director aimed  casting doubt  long-established findings about Moscow' interference   2016 election.

“It’ time   after people,” Trump said from  Oval Office   repeated  baseless claim that former President Barack Obama  other officials  engaged  treason.

Trump   making  claims   first time,   delivered them when administration officials  harnessing  machinery   federal government  investigate  targets  Trump’ derision, including  officials responsible  scrutinizing Russia' attempts  intervene  Trump' behalf  2016.

The backward-looking inquiries  taking place even   Republican administration' national security agencies  confronting global threats. But they have served   rallying   Trump,   trying  unify  political base  odds over  Jeffrey Epstein case, with some allies pressing  disclose more information despite  president' push  turn  page.

Trump' attack prompted  rare response from Obama' post-presidential office.

“Our office does  normally dignify  constant nonsense  misinformation flowing   this White House with  response,” said Patrick Rodenbush,  Obama spokesman. “But these claims  outrageous enough  merit . These bizarre allegations  ridiculous   weak attempt  distraction.”

Trump' tirade,  detour from  official business   hosted  leader   Philippines, unfolded against  backdrop    report from Director  National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that represented  administration' latest attempt  rewrite  history   Russia investigation, which  infuriated   years.

The report, released Friday, downplayed  extent  Russian interference   2016 election  highlighting Obama administration emails showing officials  concluded before  after  presidential race that Moscow   hacked state election systems  manipulate votes  Trump’ favor.

But Obama' Democratic administration never suggested otherwise, even   exposed other means  which Russia interfered   election, including through  massive hack--leak operation  Democratic emails  intelligence operatives working with WikiLeaks,  well   covert influence campaign aimed  swaying public opinion  sowing discord through fake social media posts.

Gabbard’ report appears  suggest  absence  manipulation  state election systems   basis  call into question more general Russian interference. By issuing ,  appeared  recover  standing  Trump' orbit, which just  month   seemed uncertain after Trump said   “wrong” when  previously said  believed Iran wasn' building  nuclear weapon.

“She'  hottest    room right ,” Trump said Tuesday night. “Tulsi, great  —  I know  have   more coming.”

Democrats,  their part, swiftly decried  report  factually flawed  politically motivated.

“It  sadly  surprising that DNI Gabbard,  promised  depoliticize  intelligence community,  once again weaponizing  position  amplify  president’ election conspiracy theories,” Sen. Mark Warner,   Democrat   Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote  X.

Russia’ broad interference  2016  been established through  series  investigations, including special counsel Robert Mueller’ report, which concluded that  Trump campaign welcomed  Kremlin’ help  also found insufficient evidence  establish  criminal conspiracy.

A House Intelligence Committee report also documented Russia’ meddling,    Senate Intelligence Committee, which concluded  work  2020   time when  panel    Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, ’  Trump’ secretary  state.

A different special counsel appointed   Trump Justice Department  hunt  problems   origins   Russia investigation, John Durham,  find flaws,   related  what Gabbard sought  highlight   report.

“Few episodes   nation’ history have been investigated  thoroughly   Intelligence Community’ warning  2016 that Russia  interfering   election,” said Rep. Jim Himes,   Democrat   House Intelligence Committee.

He added that every legitimate investigation, including  bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee probe, “found  evidence  politicization  endorsed  findings”   intelligence committee assessment  Russian interference made public  2017.

Gabbard' document  released weeks after  CIA report that reexamined that earlier intelligence community assessment. That  review, ordered  CIA Director John Ratcliffe,   dispute Russia  interfered  suggested officials were rushed   assessment they reached.

Ratcliffe  since referred former CIA Director John Brennan   Justice Department  investigation,  person familiar with  matter  said. The department earlier this month appeared  acknowledge  open investigation into Brennan  former FBI Director James Comey   unusual statement,   status  contours   inquiries  unclear.

Besides Obama, Trump  Tuesday rattled   list  people  accused  acting criminally “  highest level,” including Comey,  2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  former national intelligence director James Clapper.

He accused Obama, without evidence,  being  “ringleader”   conspiracy   . Obama  never been accused   wrongdoing  part   Russia investigation, ,   event,  landmark Supreme Court opinion from last year shields former presidents from prosecution  official acts conducted  office.

Trump launched  tirade when asked about  Justice Department’ effort  speak with Ghislaine Maxwell,  former girlfriend  Epstein,   convicted  helping  financier sexually abuse underage girls.

“I ’ really follow that  much,”  said. “It’ sort   witch hunt,  continuation   witch hunt.”

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  gaining some  backing  Capitol Hill from GOP senators  fear  repercussions  President Donald Trump follows through with threats    remove  politically independent central banker.

As Trump seemingly waffled back  forth this week  trying  dismiss  Fed chair, some Republicans  Congress began  speak   warn that such  move would   mistake. Trump would potentially obliterate  Fed’ independence from political influence  inject uncertainty into  foundations   U.S. economy   fires Powell.

“If anybody thinks  would   good idea   Fed  become another agency   government subject   president, they’ making  huge mistake,” GOP North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said   floor speech.

The measure  support from GOP members   Senate Committee  Banking, Housing,  Urban Affairs showed  traditional Republicans  carefully navigating  presidency  which Trump often flirts with ideas — like steep tariffs  firing  Fed chair — that threaten  undermine confidence   U.S. economy.

Tillis,  recently decided   seek reelection after clashing with Trump, later told The Associated Press that  economic fallout from Powell' firing would mostly hurt “little guys like  that grew   trailer parks that  have   thousand dollars   401k.”

He also pointed  that  underlying complaint that Trump  with  Fed —  reluctance   interest rates —   controlled  Powell alone,  instead  12-member committee.

“The markets expect  independent, central bank,” said GOP South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds,  cautioned against firing Powell. “And  they thought   minute that  wasn’ independent,  would cast  spell over  forecasts   integrity   decisions being made   bank.”

Still, plenty  other Republicans think that dismissing Powell   fine idea.

“The most incompetent, worst Federal Reserve chairman  American history should resign,” said GOP Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno.

Trump said   also encouraged  fire Powell during  meeting with about  dozen -right House members Tuesday evening.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that   “unhappy with  leadership"   Fed,  added “I’ honestly  sure whether that executive authority exists”  fire Powell.

House Financial Services Committee chair French Hill  underscored that presidents ’ have  authority  fire  Fed chair,   also been sympathetic  Trump’ complaints about Powell’ leadership. He  other Republicans have also noted that Powell’ term  chair  ending next year anyway,  Trump will have  opportunity  name   chair then.

When Congress started  Federal Reserve over 100 years ,  insulated  from political pressure  stipulating that  governors  chair could only  fired “ cause” —  higher  than most political appointees. However,  Trump administration  maneuvered  meet that standard  accusing Powell  mishandling  $2.5 billion renovation project   Fed' headquarters.

“When  initial attempts  bully Powell failed, Trump  Republicans  Congress suddenly decided  look into  much  Fed  spending  building renovations,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren,   Democrat   Senate Banking Committee, said   speech Wednesday. “Independence does  mean impunity  I have long pushed  more transparency  accountability   Fed. But give   break.”

After Powell sent Congress  letter detailing parts   renovation project, Sen. Tim Scott,  Senate Banking Committee chair, released  short statement saying Scott “ continued  call  increased transparency  accountability   Federal Reserve,  this letter  consistent with improving  communication  transparency   seeking.”

Regardless,  would  legally dubious  fire Powell over  renovation.

"That would  litigated  I ’   reason,  cause  otherwise,  remove ,” Sen. John Kennedy,  Republican member   Senate committee that oversees  Fed, told reporters this week.

He added that  understood  president' “frustration” with  Fed' reluctance  lower interest rates   tries  tamp down inflation, saying, “I  that,  I think ’ very important  Federal Reserve remains independent.”

Even those Republicans  argued that  president  grounds  fire Powell  piled criticism   central banker conceded that  would still   painful step.

“That’  decision  president will make,  ’ being very deliberate about ," said Moreno,  Ohio senator  called  Powell' resignation. “But I ’ think  should   country through   that."

House Republicans  trying  formulate  response   Trump administration’ handling  records   Jeffrey Epstein  trafficking case

WASHINGTON -- House Republicans were grasping late Thursday  formulate  response   Trump administration' handling  records   Jeffrey Epstein  trafficking case, ultimately putting forward  resolution that carries  legal weight  nodded   growing demand  greater transparency.

The House resolution, which could potentially  voted  next week, will  practically nothing  force  Justice Department  release more records   case. Still,  showed  backlash from  Republican base  putting pressure   Trump administration  roiling GOP lawmakers.

The House  held   hours Thursday from final consideration  President Donald Trump’ request  about $9 billion  government funding cuts because GOP leaders were trying  respond  demands from their  ranks that they weigh    Epstein files. In  late evening they settled   resolution   attempt  simultaneously placate calls from  -right  greater transparency  satisfy Trump,   called  issue  “hoax” that  supporters should forget about.

“The House Republicans   transparency,  they’ looking      that they agree with  White House. We agree with  president. Everything  said about that,   credible evidence should come ,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday afternoon.

Democrats vehemently decried  resolution' lack  force. They have advanced their  legislation, with support from nine Republicans, that would require  Justice Department  release more information   case.

Rep. Jim McGovern,    Democrats' debate against  Republican resolution Thursday night, called   “glorified press release”  “  leaf  they  move  from this issue.”

Under pressure from   GOP members, Johnson   demonstrate action   Epstein files  risk having Republicans support  Democratic measures that would force  release  nearly  documents.

“The American people simply need  know  truth,  whole truth,  nothing   truth,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said   news conference. “Democrats didn’  this into  public domain. The conspiracy theory provocateur--chief Donald Trump   , along with  extreme MAGA Republican associates,   this whole thing into  public domain  years. And  they  reaping what they have sown.”

Still, Democrats,  hold minorities  both chambers, have relished  opportunity  make Republicans repeatedly block their attempts  force  Justice Department  release  documents.

But  move  restrict such  subsidies would mark  significant retreat from  scope  HUD' work. Millions  tenants moved  with  promise  subsidized housing   long  they were poor enough  remain qualified,  time limits would   seismic shift that could destabilize  most vulnerable households, many unlikely  ever afford today’ record-high rents.

New research from New York University, obtained exclusively  The Associated Press, found that  families were   after  years, 1.4 million households could lose their vouchers  public housing subsidies — largely working families with children. This would lead housing authorities  evict many families,  report said.

A broad time limit would cause “substantial disruption  dislocation,”   said, noting  policy  largely untested  most    housing authorities  voluntarily   eventually abandoned  pilots.

A break from HUD' long-held purpose  helping house  poor could also jeopardize  contracts with private landlords,   they' already feeling  uncertainty  public housing authorities from Seattle  Atlanta announce they' scaling back  anticipation  federal funding cuts.

Critics fear  restriction could derail those working towards self-sufficiency — defeating  goal time-limit supporters hope  achieve.

HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back   NYU study.

“There  plenty  data that strongly supports time limits  shows that long-term government assistance without  incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans  work,” Lovett said   statement. She primarily cited statistics suggesting  employment among HUD-subsidized tenants.

Hopkins said  policy would likely leave     homeless   economy that often feels indifferent  working poor people like .

“A -year time limit  ridiculous,”  said. “It’  disrespectful. I think ’ dehumanizing —  whole system.”

Researchers from  Housing Solutions Lab  New York University’ Furman Center analyzed HUD’ data over  10-year period  found about 70%  households  could  affected   -year limit  already been living  those subsidies    more years.

That’ based  2024 estimates  doesn’ include elderly  disabled people  wouldn'  subject  time limits. Exempted households make  about half   roughly 4.9 million households getting rental assistance.

In  first study  examine  proposed policy’ possible impacts,  NYU researchers found time limits would largely punish families   working  earning  below their area’ median income, which would ultimately shift federal rental assistance away from households with kids.

“Housing assistance  especially impactful  children,” said Claudia Aiken,  study -author  director   research partnerships   Housing Solutions Lab. Their health, education, employment  earnings potential  "change  really meaningful ways  they have stable housing,”  said.

It would affect people like Hopkins, whose family    years-long waitlist   expensive region where  grew . In July 2022,     moved into  -bedroom public housing unit  Woodinville, Washington. She pays $450  month  rent — 30%   household income.

A market-rate apartment   area costs  least $2,000 more, according   King County Housing Authority, which  June announced  would pause issuing some  vouchers.

Hopkins knows  could never afford  live   home state without rental assistance. It   relief they could stay  long  they needed. She  been struggling  scrape together hundreds  dollars more  month   previous trailer home.

“There’  words    feeling like your housing  secure,” Hopkins said. “I feel like I  gasping    I’ finally able  breathe.”

She credits  housing subsidy   ability  finally leave  abusive marriage,  still dreams  more — perhaps   catering business  working   party decorator.

“We  ’  lawyers  doctors —   years ’ enough  even become that,” Hopkins said.

Since learning  Trump’ proposal, Hopkins said ' been haunted  thoughts  shoving  possessions into   with  , upending  stability  built  .

The average household  HUD-subsidized housing stays about  years, studies show.

HUD funds local public housing projects where nearly 1 million households live   Section 8 vouchers that about 4 million households   offset their private rentals.

There’ been little guidance from HUD   time-limited housing assistance would  implemented —   would  enforced, when  clock starts    exemptions would  defined.

Both Democrats  Republicans have acknowledged  potential  time limits  help curb HUD’ notorious waitlists. Hard-liners contend  threat  housing loss will push people  reach self-sufficiency; others  limits, when coupled with support  workforce incentives,   means  motivate tenants  improve their lives.

Yet there  strikingly  successful examples.

NYU researchers identified just 17 public housing authorities that have tested time limits. None   programs were designed  only  years  11 abandoned  restriction — despite being able   federal dollars  services  help people achieve self-sufficiency. Several agencies that dropped  limits said tenants still struggled  afford housing after their time  .

“These policies  complex  difficult  monitor, enforce,   well,” NYU' Aiken said.

The city  Keene, New Hampshire, tried five-year time limits starting  2001,  terminated  policy before fully enforcing   avoid kicking  households that would still  “rent burdened,  potentially homeless,” said Josh Meehan, executive director  Keene Housing.

In California, Shawnté Spears   Housing Authority  San Mateo County said  agency  kept  five-year time limit  tandem with educational programs  says have “given folks motivation”  meet their goals. It also gives more people  chance   vouchers,  said.

NYU' Aiken acknowledged HUD' long waitlists make  current system “    lottery," adding: "You could  that time limits     increasing people’ odds  that lottery.”

HUD' Section 8 programs have long depended  hundreds  thousands  -profit  nonprofit small business owners  property managers  accept tenant vouchers. Now, landlords fear  -year limit could  their contracts  HUD-subsidized housing  limbo.

Amid  uncertainty, Denise Muha, executive director   National Leased Housing Association, said multiple landlord groups have voiced their concerns about HUD' next budget   letter  congressional leaders. She said landlords generally agree  years  simply  enough time  most -income tenants  change their fortunes.

“As  practical matter, ’ going  increase your turnover, which   cost," Muha said. “Nobody wants  throw  their tenants without cause.”

It’ always been  significant lift  private landlords  work with HUD subsidies, which involve burdensome paperwork, heavy oversight  maintenance inspections.

But  trade-   near guarantee  dependable longer-term renters  rental income. If that’ compromised, some landlords  they’ pull back from  federal subsidy programs.

Brad Suster,  owns 86 Chicago-area units funded  HUD, said accepting subsidies could become risky.

“Would  have  same reliability that  know  traditionally come  countless years from  federal government?” Suster said. “That’ something landlords  owners want  know  there."

The diminishing housing stock available  -income tenants  been  brewing problem  HUD. Between 2010  2020, some 50,000 housing providers left  voucher program,  agency  reported.

It'   debate whether lawmakers will  into Trump' vision  HUD.

This week  U.S. House appropriations committee  taking  HUD' 2026 budget, which   makes  mention  time limits.

HUD' Lovett noted  Senate’ budget plans   agency have   been released,  said  administration remains focused  future implementation  time limits.

“HUD will continue  engage with colleagues   hill  ensure  seamless transition  enforcement    time limit,” Lovett said   statement.

Noëlle Porter,  director  government affairs   National Housing Law Project, said Trump’ fight  time limits   from over, noting that legislative  rule changes could make them  reality.

“It  clearly  stated goal   administration  impose work requirements  time limits  rental assistance, even though  would  wildly unpopular,” Porter said.

Democratic Rep. James Clyburn  South Carolina says there'  evidence time limits would save HUD money.

“This doesn’ help families  already  working multiple jobs  become self-sufficient,” Clyburn said   June hearing. “Instead,  creates chaos, financial uncertainty  pushes these families into more severe trade-offs.”

Time limits could imperil Aaliyah Barnes' longtime dream  graduating college  becoming  nurse, finding     home   afford.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration left many local officials   dark about  immigration detention center that rose from  isolated airstrip   Everglades, emails obtained  The Associated Press show, while relying   executive order  seize  land, hire contractors  bypass laws  regulations.

The emails show that local officials  southwest Florida were still trying  chase down  “rumor” about  sprawling “Alligator Alcatraz” facility planned  their county while state officials were already   ground  sending vendors through  gates  coordinate construction   detention center, which  designed  house thousands  migrants  went    matter  days.

“Not cool!”  local official told  state agency director spearheading  construction.

The 100-plus emails dated June 21  July 1, obtained through  public records request, underscore  breakneck speed  which  governor' team built  facility   extent  which local officials were blindsided   plans   compound  makeshift tents  trailers  Collier County,  wealthy, majority-Republican corner   state that' home  white-sand beaches   western stretch   Everglades.

The executive order, originally signed   Republican governor  2023  extended since then, accelerated  project, allowing  state  seize county-owned land  evade rules  what critics have called  abuse  power. The order granted  state sweeping authority  suspend “ statute, rule  order” seen  slowing  response   immigration “emergency.”

A representative  DeSantis   immediately respond   request  comment.

Known   Dade-Collier Training  Transition Airport,  airstrip  about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west  downtown Miami. It  located within Collier County   owned  managed  neighboring Miami-Dade County. The AP asked  similar records from Miami-Dade County, which  still processing  request.

To DeSantis  other state officials, building  facility   remote Everglades  naming  after  notorious federal prison were meant  deterrents. It’ another sign   President Donald Trump' administration   allies  relying  scare tactics  pressure people     country illegally  leave.

Collier County Commissioner Rick LoCastro apparently first heard about  proposal after  concerned resident  another county sent   email  June 21.

“A citizen  asking about  proposed ‘detention center’   Everglades?” LoCastro wrote  County Manager Amy Patterson  other staff. “Never heard  that … Am I missing something?”

“I  unaware   land  petitions that  proposing  detention center   Everglades. I’ check with  intake team,  I ’ believe  such proposal  been received  Zoning,” replied  county' planning  zoning director, Michael Bosi.

Environmental groups have since filed  federal lawsuit, arguing that  state illegally bypassed federal  state laws  building  facility.

In fact, LoCastro  included   June 21 email from state officials announcing their intention    airfield. LoCastro sits   county' governing board  does  lead ,   district does  include  airstrip. He forwarded  message   county attorney, saying “Not sure  they would send this  ?”

In  email, Kevin Guthrie,  head   Florida Division  Emergency Management, which built  detention center, said  state intended  “work collaboratively” with  counties. The message referenced  executive order  illegal immigration,     specify   state wanted    site, other than  “future emergency response, aviation logistics,  staging operations.”

The next , Collier County' emergency management director, Dan Summers, wrote   briefing   county manager  other local officials, including some notes about  “rumor”   heard about plans   immigration detention facility   airfield.

Summers knew  place well,  said, after doing  detailed site survey   years .

“The infrastructure  — well, nothing much    equipment barns   mobile home office … (  mosquito-infested)," Summers wrote.

FDEM told Summers that while  agency  surveyed  airstrip, “NO mobilization  action plans  being executed  this time”   activity  “investigatory," Summers wrote.

By June 23, Summers  racing  prepare  presentation   meeting   Board  County Commissioners  next . He shot   email  FDEM Director Kevin Guthrie seeking confirmation  basic facts about  airfield   plans   detention facility, which Summers understood   “conceptual”   “discussion  investigatory stages only.”

“Is    plans   there  actual operation   open?” Summers asked. “Rumor  operational today… ???”

In fact,  agency  already “ site with  vendors coordinating  construction   site," FDEM bureau chief Ian Guidicelli responded.

“Not cool! That’  what  relayed   last week  over  weekend,” Summers responded, adding that  would have “   face” with  Collier County Sheriff' Office  Board  County Commissioners. "It’  Collier County site. I   your team,  about  courtesy  some coordination?”

On  evening  June 23, FDEM officially notified Miami-Dade County   seizing  county-owned land  build  detention center, under emergency powers granted   executive order.

Plans   facility sparked concerns among first responders  Collier County,  questioned which agency would  responsible   emergency should strike  site.

Discussions   issue grew tense  times. Local Fire Chief Chris Wolfe wrote   county' chief  emergency medical services  other officials  June 25: "I   attempting  argue with , more simply seeking    going  prepare  this that  clearly within  jurisdiction  Collier County."

Summers,  emergency management director, repeatedly reached   FDEM  guidance, trying  “eliminate some   confusion” around  site.

As   other county officials waited  details from Tallahassee, they turned  local news outlets  information, sharing links  stories among themselves.

“Keep them coming,” Summers wrote  county Communications Director John Mullins  response   news article, “since  crickets from Tally  this point.”

Hoping  manage  blowback   county' tourism industry, local officials kept close tabs  media coverage   facility, watching   news spread rapidly from local newspapers  southwest Florida  national outlets such  The Washington Post  The New York Times  international news sites   away  Great Britain, Germany  Switzerland.

As questions from reporters  complaints from concerned residents streamed , local officials lined  legal documentation  show  airfield   their responsibility.

In  email chain labeled, “Not  circus,   monkeys...,” County Attorney Jeffrey Klatzkow wrote   county manager, “My view   have  interest  this airport parcel, which  acquired  eminent domain  Dade County  1968.”

Meanwhile, construction   site plowed ahead, with trucks arriving around  clock carrying portable toilets, asphalt  construction materials. Among  companies that snagged multimillion dollar contracts   work were those whose owners donated generously  DeSantis  other Republicans.

On July 1, just 10 days after Collier County first  wind   plans,  state officially opened  facility, welcoming DeSantis, Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  other state  federal officials   tour.

A county emergency management staffer fired   email  Summers, asking   included   site visit   facility.

“Absolutely,” Summers replied. “After  President’ visit  some   chaos -site settles-,  will    down there…”

AUSTIN, Texas -- U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez,  Texas Democrat  represents  slice   Rio Grande Valley along  border with Mexico,   last congressional election  just over 5,000 votes.

That makes   tempting target  Republicans,   poised  redraw  state' congressional maps this coming week  devise five  winnable seats   GOP that would help  party avoid losing House control   2026 elections. Adjusting  lines  Gonzalez’ district  bring    thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones , could flip  seat.

Gonzalez said    worried. Those Democratic voters will have        Republican districts that flank Gonzalez’ current , making those districts more competitive — possibly enough   could flip  seats  Democrats.

“Get ready  some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that  party  already recruiting challengers  Republicans whose districts they expect   destabilized   process. “We’ talking  some veterans, ’ talking  some former  enforcement.”

Texas  38 seats   House. Republicans  hold 25  Democrats 12, with  seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner,  former Houston mayor, died  March.

Gonzalez' district —  what happens   neighboring GOP-held ones —    crux  President Donald Trump' high-risk, high-reward push   Texas Republicans  redraw their political . Trump  seeking  avoid  traditional midterm letdown that most incumbent presidents endure  hold onto  House, which  GOP narrowly controls.

Trump' push comes  there  numerous political danger signs   presidency, both   recent turmoil over  administration' handling   Jeffrey Epstein case    polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center  Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think  policies have  helped them  that     spending bill will help  wealthy.

The fear  accidentally creating unsafe seats   reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously  2021, when  constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked    50 states. Mapmakers —  most states, '  party that controls  legislature — must adjust congressional  state legislative lines after every 10-year census  ensure that districts have about  same number  residents.

That   golden opportunity   party     against  other,  tactic known  gerrymandering. But there   term, ,   aggressively redrawing   that  puts that party'  seats  risk:  “dummymander.”

The Texas GOP knows  risk. In  2010s,  Republican-controlled Legislature drew political lines that helped   GOP’ House majority. That lasted until 2018, when  backlash against Trump   first term  Democrats  flip  seats  Texas that Republicans  thought safe.

In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably  charge   Texas Statehouse,  party  cautious, opting    that mainly shored  their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats.

Still, plenty  Republicans believe their Texas counterparts  safely   offense.

“Smart -drawing  yield pickup opportunities while  putting  incumbents  jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director   National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking   party nationally..

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called  special session   Legislature, which starts Monday,  comply with Trump' request  redraw  congressional maps   address  flooding  Texas Hill Country that killed  least 135 people this month.

Democratic state lawmakers  talking about staying away from  Capitol  deny  Legislature  minimum number needed  convene. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton posted that  Democrats   that should  arrested.

Lawmakers   fined   $500    breaking  quorum after  House changed  rules when Democrats initiated  walkout  2021. Despite   penalties, state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer,    walkout  2021, left open  possibility  another.

“I ’ think anybody should underestimate  will  Texas Democrats,"  said.

Texas    only Republican state engaged  -decade redistricting. After staving   ballot measure  expand  power   mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope  redraw their congressional  from  10-5  favoring  GOP    lopsided  13-2,   state Trump  last year with 55%   vote.

Democrats have fewer options. More   states  party controls   allow elected partisans  draw maps  entrust independent commissions  draw fair lines.

Some party leaders, such  California Gov. Gavin Newsom,  maneuvering    find ways around their commissions  counter Texas,  they have  options.

The  Democrat-controlled states that  allow elected officials  draw  lines, such  Illinois, have already seen Democrats   their advantages.

Trump   allies have been rallying Texas Republicans  ignore whatever fears they     .

On Tuesday,  president posted   social media site  reminder   record   state last November: “Won     half million Votes,  almost 14%. Also,     Border Counties along Mexico, something which  never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,’    just another Democrat LIE.”

Texas  long been eyed   state trending Democratic because   growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year  helped Trump expand  margin  14 percentage points,  significant improvement   6-point   2020.

Michael Li,  Texas native  longtime watcher   state   Brennan Center  Justice  New York, said there’    know whether that trend will continue  next year’ elections  whether  state will return   blue-trending ways.

“Anyone   tell  what  politics  Texas looks like   balance   decade   better crystal ball than I ,” Li said.

One region   state where Republican gains have been steady   Rio Grande Valley, which runs from  Gulf  Mexico along much   state’ southern border. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live,  rallied around Trump’ tough--immigration, populist message.

As  result, Gonzalez   area’ other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns  steadily tighter. They  widely speculated      targets    .

The GOP  expected  look   state’ three biggest cities  find  other Democratic targets. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts   Houston, Dallas  Austin areas, they could   five additional seats.

But  doing , Republicans face  legal risk    their electoral : that they break  districts required   Voting Rights Act  have  critical amount  certain minority groups. The goal   federal    enable those communities  elect representatives  their choosing.

The Texas GOP already  facing  lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging  initial 2021   this. If this year' redistricting   aggressive,  could trigger  second complaint.

“It’ politically  legally risky,” Li said   redistricting strategy. “It’ throwing caution   winds.”

A Republican candidate  Georgia governor accuses  rival  illegally lending $10 million   campaign committee

ATLANTA -- A Republican candidate  Georgia governor asked  state ethics body Thursday  determine whether  GOP rival illegally lent $10 million   campaign committee  evade restrictions under state campaign finance .

Attorney General Chris Carr’ campaign lawyer asked  Georgia Ethics Commission   legal opinion saying Lt. Gov. Burt Jones  prohibited from making  loan   leadership committee,  special fundraising vehicle that allows  governor, lieutenant governor  legislative leaders  raise unlimited funds.

A spokesperson  Jones called  complaint  “weak attempt   attention”   statement.

Carr  some other candidates  state office cannot have  -called leadership committees  campaign fundraising under  2021 state  that created  committees unless they  their party’ nomination  governor  lieutenant governor. Instead, they  limited  candidate committees, which  raise  maximum  $8,400 from each donor. Opponents  that'  unfair advantage  incumbents.

Jones  Carr  competing   Republican nomination  succeed Gov. Brian Kemp,  legally '  again after  terms. The GOP primary  next May, followed   general election  November 2026.

Jones filed documents showing  made loans  $7.5 million  $2.5 million   WBJ Leadership Committee when  announced  long-anticipated   governor  July 8.

The cash infusion  part  Jones’ strategy   himself    front-runner   race.

Carr announced    governor last year, saying  needed  long runway  raise money because  ' personally wealthy. Carr' campaign  been voicing concerns  months that Jones will   leadership committee   family wealth from  string   stations    primary.

Bryan Tyson,  lawyer  Carr’ campaign,  Thursday requested  advisory opinion from  Ethics Commission  whether  loans  legal. Tyson argued that under Georgia , loans   made only   candidate committee,    freestanding political action committee,  even  leadership committee, which  allowed  coordinate with  candidate committee.

Carr’ campaign cited  2022 federal judge’ ruling that  leadership committee  Gov. Brian Kemp could  spend money   Kemp reelected during  Republican primary that year. U.S. District Judge Mark Cohen found that  “unequal campaign finance scheme” violated challenger David Perdue’ First Amendment right  free speech.

Jones spokesperson Kendyl Parker said   statement   “ surprised  this weak attempt   attention — ’ exactly what ’ expect from  campaign that’ losing steam with many months   until Election Day.”

Tyson suggested that  Jones could make  loan   leadership committee  then raise unlimited sums  repay himself,  could give  repaid money   candidate committee  spend   primary. That would evade Cohen’      leadership committee money   primary. Tyson warned that such laundering would “wash away contribution limits entirely.”

The Ethics Commission must issue  advisory opinion within 60 days under state .

In  related complaint   commission  Thursday, Tyson alleged that Jones broke state  because  previous financial disclosures didn’ show that   $10 million  cash  securities   able  afford such large loans.

Tyson pointed   2022 financial disclosure that showed Jones    worth  $12.4 million,  only $700,000  cash  securities. The rest  tied    value  real estate  Jones’ insurance agency,  disclosure stated. Tyson noted that Jones’ 2024 disclosure showed  hadn’ sold real estate   business, arguing “ appears  could  have sufficient liquid assets  loan  leadership committee $10 million.”

Ethics complaints  take years  resolve,  Tyson said   “imperative” that  commission move quickly  determine  source   loan, whether   properly reported  whether Jones planned  spend from  leadership committee   primary.

WASHINGTON -- Maurene Comey,  daughter  former FBI director James Comey    federal prosecutor  Manhattan worked  cases against Sean “Diddy” Combs  Jeffrey Epstein, said   note  colleagues that “fear   tool   tyrant”  that  firing without reason should fuel “ fire  righteous indignation  abuses  power.”

“If  career prosecutor   fired without reason, fear  seep into  decisions  those  remain,” Comey said   note, which  obtained  The Associated Press  Thursday. “Do   that happen. Fear   tool   tyrant, wielded  suppress independent thought."

“Instead  fear,”  added, “ this moment fuel  fire that already burns   heart  this place. A fire  righteous indignation  abuses  power. Of commitment  seek justice  victims. Of dedication  truth above  else.”

Until  firing Wednesday, Comey  been  veteran lawyer   Southern District  New York, long considered  most elite   Justice Department’ prosecution offices. Her cases included   trafficking prosecution  Epstein,  killed himself behind bars  2019    awaiting trial,   recent case against Combs, which ended earlier this month with  mixed verdict.

Her termination represented  latest Justice Department effort  fire lawyers without explanation,  trend that  raised alarm over  disregard  civil service protections designed  prevent terminations  political reasons. The department  also fired  number  prosecutors  worked  cases that have provoked Donald Trump’ , including some  handled U.S. Capitol riot cases  lawyers  support staff  worked  special counsel Jack Smith’ prosecutions   Republican president.

She  long seen   potential target given  father’ fraught relationship over  last decade with Trump. The Justice Department recently appeared  acknowledge  existence   investigation into James Comey, though  basis  that inquiry  unclear.

Maurene Comey  most recently been among  prosecutors    trafficking  racketeering case against Combs. The failure  convict  - mogul   main charges, while gaining  conviction  prostitution-related charges that will likely result   prison sentence  just   years,  viewed  some fellow lawyers   rare defeat  prosecutors.

But   successful  numerous other prosecutions, most notably  conviction  Ghislaine Maxwell   trafficking charges  helping financier Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. In that case,  delivered  rebuttal argument during closings,      Combs case.

Her firing comes  Attorney General Pam Bondi faces intense criticism from some members  Trump’ base   Justice Department’ decision   release  more evidence   government’ possession from Epstein’  trafficking investigation.

James Comey   FBI director when Trump took office  2017, having been appointed  then-President Barack Obama,  Democrat,  serving before that   senior Justice Department official  Republican President George W. Bush’ administration.

But  relationship with Trump  strained from  start. The FBI director resisted  request  Trump   private dinner  pledge personal loyalty   president —  overture that  unnerved  FBI director that  documented    contemporaneous memorandum.

Trump soon after fired Comey amid  investigation into potential ties between Russia  Trump’ presidential campaign. That inquiry, later taken over  special counsel Robert Mueller, would ultimately find that while Russia interfered with  2016 election   Trump team welcomed  help, there  insufficient evidence  prove  criminal collaboration.

Trump’ fury   older Comey continued long after firing  from  bureau, blaming    “hoax”  “witch hunt” that shadowed much   first term.

Comey disclosed contemporaneous memos   conversations with Trump   friend  that their content could  revealed   media. The following year, Comey published  book calling Trump “ driven”  likening    mafia . Trump,   part,  accused Comey  other officials  treason.

CLEVELAND -- President Donald Trump  threatening  hold    stadium deal  Washington' NFL team   does  restore   name   Redskins, which  considered offensive  Native Americans.

Trump also said Sunday that  wants Cleveland' baseball team  revert   former name,  Indians, saying there   “ clamoring  this"  well.

Trump said  Washington football team would  “much more valuable”   restored   name.

“I    restriction  them that  they ’ change  name back   original ‘Washington Redskins,’      ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,’ I ’ make  deal  them  build  Stadium  Washington," Trump said   social media site.

His latest interest  changing  name reflects  broader effort  roll back changes that followed  national debate  cultural sensitivity  racial justice. The team announced  would drop  Redskins name   Indian head logo  2020 during  broader reckoning with systemic racism  police brutality.

The Commanders   District  Columbia government announced  deal earlier this year  build   home   football team   site   RFK Stadium,  place  franchise called home  more than three decades.

Trump' ability  hold   deal remains   seen. President Joe Biden signed  bill  January that transferred  land from  federal government   District  Columbia.

The provision  part   short-term spending bill passed  Congress  December. While D.C. residents elect  mayor,  city council  commissioners   -- operations, Congress maintains control   city’ budget.

Josh Harris, whose group bought  Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder  2023, said earlier this year  name  here  stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back  Redskins, saying that would  happen. The team   immediately respond   request  comment following Trump' statement.

“We understand there  different perspectives   decision  made   years ,  obviously ’  decision  made. We’   opportunity  build  brand   Guardians over  last four years   excited about  future that'  front  ,"  said.

Cleveland announced  December 2020  would drop Indians. It announced  switch  Guardians  July 2021. In 2018,  team phased  "Chief Wahoo”   primary logo.

The name changes  their share  supporters  critics  part   national discussions about logos  names considered racist.

Trump posted Sunday afternoon that “The Owner   Cleveland Baseball Team, Matt Dolan,   very political,  lost three Elections    because  that ridiculous name change. What  doesn’ understand  that   changed  name back   Cleveland Indians,  might actually   Election. Indians  being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!”

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists  hasn’ wavered   duty  protect  civil rights  America’ children even   dismantles  Education Department. Yet   data shows  agency  resolved  fewer civil rights cases than  past years despite families filing more complaints.

The Education Department’ civil rights branch lost nearly half  staff amid mass layoffs  March, raising questions about  ability  address  deep backlog  complaints from students alleging discrimination based  disability,   race. Pressed   issue  June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied  slowdown.

“Not only   reducing  backlog,    keeping  with  current amount with  reduced staff because   doing  efficiently,” McMahon said   Senate budget hearing.

By several measures, however,  output   Office  Civil Rights appears  have fallen sharply  comparison with previous years. A public database   office’ resolution agreements — cases  which schools  universities voluntarily agreed  address civil rights concerns — suggests  office’ work  slowed.

The database lists just 65 resolutions   this year,  pace  fall  below previous years’ totals. Last year  office logged 380 resolutions  total, following 561  2023. During President Donald Trump’ first term,  office averaged more than 800 resolutions  year, including 1,300 during  first year  office.

Other internal data obtained  The Associated Press show  similar trend. Since Trump took office,  total number  resolved cases  down about 40% from  same time frame last year — including cases that were dismissed, mediated  reached  voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also  been  70% decrease   number  cases resolved through resolution agreements  action taken   school  comply with federal ,  internal data shows.

Meanwhile,  complaints have increased 9%. The total number  cases   climbed beyond 25,000.

An Education Department spokesperson said  Trump administration  fixing  broken system.

“When staff levels were  their peak, OCR’ processes still proved   ineffective,  evidenced   chronic backlog  tens  thousands  cases that left students’ discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,” spokesperson Julie Hartman said.

Parents  advocates  they’ noticed  difference.

Adrienne Hazel filed  complaint  April after  20-year-  Ricky,   autism,  placed   public school program without  certified teacher    given  individual learning plan. Hazel,  Southfield, Michigan,   heard from  federal office after receiving  automatic reply when  filed  complaint.

Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed  separate complaint   . The office notified Ricky’ school, which Hazel says spurred  district  reach  agreement with  within about three months. This time,  said,  feels like ’   .

“There  been zero response  this,”  said. “He’ basically going into  babysitting situation. He’  getting  things that  needs  grow into independence. And ’ just  aging without getting  education.”

Marcie Lipsitt,  special education advocate  Michigan  worked with Hazel, said such stories  common. She helps families file complaints  warns  could take  least  year before  investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked  previous agreements,  said,  parents ’   response from  federal office.

“It’ horrible. I’ watching children suffer like they’ never suffered,”  said. “There   accountability.”

The fate   Education Department itself   question   Trump administration moves ahead with  plan  wind down  agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared     agency  continue mass layoffs  outsource some functions  other agencies. McMahon previously suggested  civil rights work could  managed   Justice Department.

Still, McMahon said  June that  office  making headway after inheriting  backlog  20,000 cases from  Biden administration. She told senators  office  catching    backlog  keeping  with  complaints.

With half  staff, many question  that’ possible. In  June court order pausing  termination  Office  Civil Rights employees,  federal judge  Boston said  branch  “currently incapable  addressing  vast majority”  complaints. More than 200   office’ employees remain  leave while that case  decided.

The Office  Civil Rights  responsible  enforcing civil rights laws across  nation’ schools   often  last resort  parents  students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints ,  those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others  dismissed  move   mediation process.

Of  65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those,  vast majority involve complaints  discrimination based  disability, with smaller numbers based    race. Most    discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes   women’ sports,   Trump’ campaign promises.

"OCR will continue  meet  statutory responsibilities while driving  improve efficiency  resolve  longstanding backlog,“ Hartman said.

Multiple workers   office  spoke  condition  anonymity  fear  retaliation said caseloads have grown    manage. In last year’ budget request,  office said   becoming difficult  keep  when investigative staff averaged 42 cases  person. Some estimates   current caseload beyond 200.

The employees said  means more cases will languish.

Another parent  Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn’ heard from  department since  filed  complaint  May. Her , Brady,   blind       learning disability, wasn’ getting  type  help  school promised, including access  teachers’ notes  reduced coursework.

“It’ been  frustrating   even have  update  ,” said Clouse,  Ann Arbor. “He  going    high school  fail. I feel like  child will    high school diploma   stays  Ann Arbor Public Schools.”

Sales  previously occupied U.S. homes slid  June   slowest pace since last September  mortgage rates remained elevated  national median sales prices  unprecedented levels

LOS ANGELES -- Sales  previously occupied U.S. homes slid  June   slowest pace since last September  mortgage rates remained elevated  national median sales prices  unprecedented levels.

Existing home sales fell 2.7% last month from May   seasonally adjusted annual rate  3.93 million units,  National Association  Realtors said Wednesday.

Sales were flat compared with June last year. The latest home sales fell short   4.01 million pace economists were expecting, according  FactSet.

Home prices increased   annual basis   24th consecutive month. The national median sales price rose 2%  June from  year earlier  $435,300,  -time high.

The U.S. housing market  been   slump since early 2022, when mortgage rates began  climb from pandemic- lows. Home sales fell last year  their lowest level  nearly 30 years.

Sluggish home sales    lackluster spring homebuying season, traditionally  busiest period   year   housing market.

Stubbornly high mortgage rates  rising prices have intensified  hardships  would- homebuyers   already been pummeled   real estate market that overheated during  pandemic. And while  number  homes   market  increased sharply from  year ,  remains well below normal levels, meaning prices continue  rise even  sales slow.

“The second half   year really depends  what happens with mortgage rates,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’ chief economist.

High mortgage rates   hundreds  dollars  month  costs  borrowers, limiting their purchasing power. So  this year,  average rate   30-year mortgage  remained relatively close  7%, according  mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.

Homes purchased last month likely went under contract  May  June, when  average rate   30-year mortgage ranged from 6.76%  6.89%.

Yun estimates that   average rate   30-year mortgage were  fall  6% that would lead   additional roughly half-million more homes sold.

“If  mortgage rate remains stuck  this level,   essentially looking  very small changes   home sales  home price condition,    mortgage rate   drop,  know there will   more meaningful increase  sales,”  said.

The housing market' affordability crunch  keeping many aspiring first-time homebuyers   sidelines. They accounted  30%  homes sales last month, unchanged from May, NAR said. Historically, they made  40%  home sales.

Home shoppers   afford    current mortgage rates    cash  benefiting from more properties   market.

There were 1.53 million unsold homes     last month, down 0.6% from May,   nearly 16% from June last year, NAR said. That’ still well below  roughly 2 million homes  sale that  typical before  pandemic, however.

June’ month- inventory translates   4.7-month supply   current sales pace,  from  4.6-month pace     May  4 months  June last year. Traditionally,  5-  6-month supply  considered  balanced market between buyers  sellers.

Homes  sale  staying   market longer  sales remain   doldrums. Properties typically remained   market  27 days last month before selling,  from 22 days  June last year, NAR said.

PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian José Natal  Silva often tends   modest coffee plantation   interior  Rio  Janeiro state   middle   night, sacrificing sleep  fend  pests that could inflict harm   precious crops.

But anxiety  troubled  shut- even more  recent weeks, following President Donald Trump’ announcement earlier this month   50% tariff  Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect  drive down  price  coffee  Brazil.

Da Silva sighed   recounted  fears, sitting    earth surrounded   glossy green arabica coffee shrubs,   small municipality  Porciuncula.

“We’  because  struggle  much. We spend years battling   somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart,  ’ going  lose everything,”  Silva said. “How   going  survive?”

Trump’ tariff  Brazil  overtly political. In  public letter detailing  reasons   hike,  U.S. president called  trial   ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro,  “ witch hunt.” Bolsonaro  accused  masterminding  coup  overturn  2022 election loss  left-leaning President Luiz Inácio Lula  Silva.

The tariff  sparked ripples  fear  Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties   American market such  beef, orange juice —  coffee. Minor coffee producers   import  will  their margins  adds   uncertainty already generated   increasingly   unpredictable climate.

Brazil,  world’ largest coffee producer, exports around 85%   production. The United States   country’  coffee buyer  represents around 16%  exports, according  Brazil’ coffee exporters council Cecafe.

The president  Cecafe’ deliberative council, Márcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that  thinks  U.S. will continue  import Brazilian coffee, even with  hefty tariff. “It’ obvious that neither  United States   other source  give   Brazil, even  ’ tariffed,”  said.

But  tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee’ competitiveness   U.S.  naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio,  professor  global agribusiness  Insper business school  Sao Paulo.

“There’     quickly redirect  coffee production  other markets,” Gilio said. “This principally affects small producers,  have less financial power  make investments  support themselves   period like this.”

Family farmers produce more than -thirds  Brazilian coffee. They   majority  Rio state’ northwestern region, where most   state’ coffee production lies.

Coffee farming   primary economic activity  these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil’ largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains  layered with symmetrical lines  coffee shrubs.

Da Silva,  wore  straw   protection from     crucifix around  neck, owns around 40,000 coffee trees. He started working   fields when   12.

Besides coffee,  grows cassava, squash, bananas, oranges  lemons     chickens that provide fresh eggs. “We have them because   fear   being able  . We wouldn’ manage  everything were bought, because  profit  very ,”  said.

Last year, drought — made more likely  human-caused climate change — devastated large swathes   Silva' production. The reduction  supply pushed coffee prices ,  only after many small-scale farmers  already sold  their crops.

Since peaking  February, prices  arabica have fallen, dropping 33%  July, according   University  Sao Paulo’ Center  Advanced Studies  Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.

“When  make  investment, counting   certain price  coffee,  then when    sell   price  20-30% less than  calculated,  breaks  producers,” said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31,  also owns  modest plantation  around 35,000 coffee trees   nearby municipality  Varre-Sai.

Life    fields  tough, according  Menezes Freitas.

During harvest season,  sometimes gets   3 ..  turn   coffee drier, going    late  midnight. The rest   year  less intense,  still, there     breaks because there’ always work  ,  said.

Menezes Freitas,   expecting  first child  October, said  tariff’ announcement increased  fears   future.

“It’ scary. It feels like ’  shaky ground. If things  worse, what will  ? People will start pulling  their coffee  finding other ways  survive because they ’ have  means  continue,”  said.

In addition  slashing  value   coffee beans, Menezes Freitas said  tariff will impact machinery  aluminum — goods that producers like   every .

“We hope this calms down. Hopefully, they’ come  their senses  remove that tariff. I think  would  better  both  United States  Brazil,”  said.

No question   small when Kayla Chege,  high school student  Kansas,  using artificial intelligence.

The sophomore honors student makes  point   have chatbots   homework  tries  limit  interactions  mundane questions. But  interviews with The Associated Press    study, teenagers  they  increasingly interacting with AI    were  companion, capable  providing advice  friendship.

“Everyone uses AI  everything . It’ really taking over,” said Chege,  wonders  AI tools will affect  generation. “I think kids  AI     thinking.”

For  past couple  years, concerns about cheating  school have dominated  conversation around kids  AI. But artificial intelligence  playing  much larger role  many  their lives. AI, teens ,  become  - source  personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making  problem-solving.

More than 70%  teens have used AI companions  half  them regularly, according    study from Common Sense Media,  group that studies  advocates  using screens  digital media sensibly.

The study defines AI companions  platforms designed  serve  “digital friends,” like Character.AI  Replika, which   customized with specific traits  personalities   offer emotional support, companionship  conversations that  feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT  Claude, which mainly answer questions,  being used   same ,  researchers .

As  technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers  experts worry about AI’ potential  redefine human relationships  exacerbate crises  loneliness  youth mental health.

“AI  always available. It never gets bored with . It’ never judgmental,” says Ganesh Nair,  18-year-  Arkansas. “When ’ talking  AI,   always right. You’ always interesting. You  always emotionally justified.”

All that used   appealing,   Nair heads  college this fall,  wants  step back from using AI. Nair  spooked after  high school friend  relied   “AI companion”  heart--heart conversations with  girlfriend later   chatbot write  breakup text ending  -year relationship.

“That felt  little  dystopian, that  computer generated     real relationship,” said Nair. “It’ almost like   allowing computers  replace  relationships with people.”

In  Common Sense Media survey, 31%  teens said their conversations with AI companions were “ satisfying  more satisfying” than talking with real friends. Even though half  teens said they distrust AI' advice, 33%  discussed serious  important issues with AI instead  real people.

Those findings  worrisome, says Michael Robb,  study’ lead author  head researcher  Common Sense,  should send  warning  parents, teachers  policymakers. The -booming  largely unregulated AI industry  becoming  integrated with adolescence  smartphones  social media .

“It’ -opening,” said Robb. “When      this survey,    understanding   many kids  actually using AI companions.” The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide  April  May.

Adolescence   critical time  developing identity, social skills  independence, Robb said,  AI companions should complement —  replace — real-world interactions.

“If teens  developing social skills  AI platforms where they  constantly being validated,  being challenged,  learning  read social cues  understand somebody else’ perspective, they   going   adequately prepared   real world,”  said.

The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions   “ risk assessment,” finding ineffective  restrictions  that  platforms  produce sexual material, give dangerous advice  offer harmful content. The group recommends that minors   AI companions.

Researchers  educators worry about  cognitive costs  youth  rely heavily  AI, especially  their creativity, critical thinking  social skills. The potential dangers  children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when  14-year- Florida  died  suicide after developing  emotional attachment   Character.AI chatbot.

Telzer’ research  found that children  young  8  using generative AI  also found that teens  using AI  explore their sexuality   companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that     apps teens frequent  SpicyChat AI,  free role-playing  intended  adults.

Many teens also  they  chatbots  write emails  messages  strike  right tone  sensitive situations.

“One   concerns that comes   that they  longer have trust  themselves  make  decision,” said Telzer. “They need feedback from AI before feeling like they  check    that  idea  OK  .”

“If  tell   plan   essay, I would think  going  ChatGPT before getting   pencil,” Perry said. He uses AI daily   asked chatbots  advice  social situations,  help  decide what  wear   write emails  teachers, saying AI articulates  thoughts faster.

Perry says  feels fortunate that AI companions were  around when   younger.

“I’ worried that kids could  lost  this,” Perry said. “I could    that grows  with AI  seeing  reason     park    make  friend.”

Other teens agree, saying  issues with AI   effect  children’ mental health  different from those  social media.

“Social media complemented  need people have   seen,   known,  meet  people,” Nair said. “I think AI complements another need that runs   deeper —  need  attachment   need  feel emotions. It feeds   that.”

“It’   addiction,” Nair added. “That’  I  .”

Ishiba “keeps saying   staying . What   public' verdict   election  about?" said Yuichiro Tamaki, head   surging Democratic Party   People,  DPP.

At  LDP,  group  younger lawmakers   Yasutaka Nakasone started  petition drive seeking Ishiba' early resignation  renewal  party leadership.

“We  have  sense  crisis  think  election results were ultimatum from  voters,”  said.

Japanese media reported that Ishiba  expected  soon announce plans  step down  August.

Ishiba denied  report  said that  wants  focus   U.S. trade deal, which covers more than 4,000 goods affecting many Japanese producers  industries. He welcomed   agreement, which places tariffs  15%  Japanese cars  other goods imported into  U.S. from Japan, down from  initial 25%.

Still, local media  already speculating about possible successors. Among them  ultraconservative former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi,  lost  Ishiba  September. Another conservative -minister, Takayuki Kobayashi,  Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi,    former popular Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi,  also seen  potential challengers.

In Sunday' election, voters frustrated with price increases exceeding  pace  wage hikes, especially younger people  have long felt ignored   ruling government' focus  senior voters, rapidly turned   emerging conservative DPP  right-wing populist Sanseito party.

None   opposition parties have shown interest  forming  full-fledged alliance with  governing coalition,  they have said they  open  cooperating  policy.

People expressed mixed reaction  Ishiba,   days seem   numbered.

Kentaro Nakamura, 53, said that  thought ' time  Ishiba  , because  lacked consistency   poorly   election.

“The (election) result     I thought  would   appropriate    stay ," Nakamura said. "I thought   just  matter  time.”

But Isamu Kawana,  Tokyo resident   70s,  more sympathetic  said   wasn' Ishiba   elected prime minister last year,  result would have been  same.

NEW YORK -- On  sweltering summer , children leap between rocks along  Bronx River while cyclists pedal  newly paved paths. Kayaks rest  what  once  industrial dumping ground,  transformed into  bustling promenade along  city’ only freshwater river.

The Bronx River Greenway,  series  stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned  polluted wasteland,   hard-fought victory   country’ poorest congressional district —  that locals call  “beacon  environmental justice” built  federal dollars  water-pollution settlements from  borough’ wealthier neighbors.

Now, like thousands  nonprofits around  country, this organization’ future   jeopardy. The Trump administration’ sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide   communities they serve  precarious straits. But  places face  stark  reckoning   Bronx, where federal funding  proved indispensable  revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors  domestic violence,  preventing youth violence.

Over 84%   342 nonprofits based   Bronx rely  federal grants   risk, according   analysis   Urban Institute. It’  significant increase from  70%  groups vulnerable  government defunding statewide.

In      country’ 437 congressional districts,  typical nonprofit could  cover  expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served  contractors  government services — like operating homeless shelters — since  1960s.

In  Bronx,  such grants were  disappear entirely,  borough’ nonprofits could face  collective deficit  nearly 30% — cuts that have begun  force layoffs  austerity  dozens  groups connecting Bronxites  -cost health care, food assistance,  preschool slots.

“When America sneezes,  Bronx gets  ,” said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres,  Democrat  represents  district. “I think    Bronx feel  have been  will continue    hardest    impact   Trump presidency.”

Nestled   corner  parkland atop  site   abandoned amusement park,  headquarters   Bronx River Alliance  among  borough’ greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples   river’ flora  fauna,   storage space teeming with kayaks  canoes.

In March,  group received formal notice that  would lose $1.5 million  federal grants promised under  Inflation Reduction Act last year  improving water quality  climate-resilience projects. After years  rising momentum, cubicles   empty. Leaders held   hiring  anticipation  cuts,   they ’ know  they’  able  fill those roles.

“I’  some   folks  were pulling cars    river   ’70s  ’80s,” said Daniel Ranells,  group’ deputy director  programs. Back then,  area   “dumping ground”  inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens,  microwaves that “folks didn’ really understand there   river there.”

That  shifted dramatically  recent years thanks  part  decades  federal investment. Just south   headquarters,  organization restored salt marshes along  riverbanks   shuttered concrete plant.

In 2007,  first beaver appeared   Bronx River  over 200 years — named “José  Beaver”  honor  former Congressman José E. Serrano,  helped direct millions  federal funds  groups dedicated   river’ restoration.

“The Bronx River   shining light  environmental justice,” Ranells said,  millions  federal funding over  years  helped “make   destination” after years  neglect.

Now staffers   Bronx River Alliance describe  sense  “whiplash”  seeing hard-fought funds    grant language scrubbed   allusions  racial  environmental justice.

The Bronx River Alliance  joined other nonprofits  suing  Trump administration  unfreeze funds,   uncertainty  already disrupted years  planning,  reality that  rippled across  neighborhood, leaving  organizations untouched.

Up  street from  Alliance,  office   Osborne Association,  group that  worked  prevent youth violence  nearly  century,  grown quieter. In April,  email from  Bureau  Justice Assistance stated  remaining $666,000   $2 million grant “ longer effectuates department priorities.”

The  thrust  nonprofit into “triage mode,” said Osborne president Jonathan Monsalve,   forced    three staffers  reduce  number  participants   diversion program offering young adults facing  charges  alternative  jail time.

“It’  lifeline  young people,  ’  longer there  25 more  them,” Monsalve said. “Without another alternative, ’ 25 young people that will  prison  jail time,  that’ incredibly frustrating.”

The Department  Justice  canceled over $810 million  similar grants  nonprofits working  violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted  cancel $2 billion  grants  environmental justice work.

Nonprofit leaders   cuts  hardest   places that  afford them  least. In  Bronx, almost 30 percent  residents live  poverty,  vast majority  whom  Black  Latino,  nearly    schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.

“We’  decades  disinvestment  these communities,    been starting   some meaningful investment  community-based solutions that were actually working,” said Monsalve. “And then    sudden that support just gets yanked away.”

The federal government,  said,  essentially telling these communities: “You aren’  priority anymore. You ’   plan.”

For decades,  million-dollar federal grant allowed  victim-service organization Safe Horizon  operate  program that stationed domestic violence advocates   borough’ criminal court.

When  grant came   renewal this year,  came with  restrictions that CEO Liz Roberts described  “ extreme,  broad,  radical” that  organization chose  walk away rather than accept conditions which would have prohibited supporting transgender survivors  treating domestic violence   systemic issue.

It   agonizing decision given  volume  domestic violence   Bronx, Roberts said.

It means that hundreds  survivors “  have  opportunity  talk   advocate about their options, about their rights,  about their safety,”  said.

Roberts said ’ bracing  more cuts — federal funds make  about 24%   group’ budget — that could force  closure  shelters  reductions   citywide hotline.

As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy  local governments will need  “make some smart  thoughtful  principled decisions about where they  help  fill those gaps.”

In places like  Bronx, finding alternative funding  especially challenging. “The --profit sector  often fragile,  nowhere more  than  Bronx,” Torres said   district  represents, where organizations tend   more dependent  government funding than wealthier enclaves.

“Organizations spent hundreds  thousands  dollars simply  apply   contract  hired staff  made  these plans only    written contract disappear,” Torres said. “It’ deeply destabilizing.”

For nonprofits  McDowell County, West Virginia,  federal cuts   One Big Beautiful Bill Act threaten  lifeline.

Many  McDowell’ 17,000 residents rely  federal programs   nonprofits they fund   . The county’  base  population have significantly declined since 1950, when McDowell    coal-producing county   nation   about 100,000 residents.

Now, more than half  children   county receive federal Children’ Health Insurance Program benefits,  about -third  seniors   Medicaid,  federal health insurance program   poor. Decades after  Kennedy administration made  county  first test  food stamps, nearly half  county’ residents receive supplemental nutrition assistance,  SNAP,  Food Stamp Program’ successor.

The strains created   eligibility restrictions  SNAP   result   passage  President Trump’ domestic policy bill will  especially dire  places like McDowell County, where more than -third   population lives below  federal poverty line, said Rosemary Ketchum, executive director   West Virginia Nonprofit Association.

“These federal cuts  starving people,”  said.

Since  interruption  federal support tied  President Trump’ January executive orders barring grants related  “gender ideology”; diversity, equity,  inclusion;  environmental justice, Ketchum said many   9,000   nonprofits   state have laid  staff. Others,  said,  dipping into whatever reserves they have   their employees.

Those reserves  slim,  they exist  . Taken together,  seven nonprofits that receive federal grants  McDowell County    3 percent operating margin, according  data tabulated   Urban Institute’ National Center  Charitable Statistics. If  federal support disappeared,  center found,   county’ nonprofits would   risk  going under unless other funding  provided.

In  poor state like West Virginia, which  already facing  budget deficit  lacks  legions  philanthropic donors   rich  Wall Street   Silicon Valley, nonprofits ’ have  plan B, said Kathy Gentry, executive director  Safe Housing  Economic Development,  SHED,  McDowell nonprofit housing provider.

The nonprofit’ clients, many  whom  elderly  disabled, rely  U.S. Housing  Urban Development support  cover  rent   94 housing units SHED manages.

Gentry’   temporarily    weeks this spring because part   salary comes from  HUD capacity-building grant that  administration deemed  cross-purposes with Trump’ anti-DEI policy agenda. Her full paycheck resumed,  Gentry worries further cuts will force     staff.

Already  nonprofit operates   loss. In  2023  filing,  most recent available, SHED’ $663,000  expenses outstripped  revenue  nearly $200,000.

“We’   quandary here —  nonprofits ,” Gentry said. “Are  going  exist? Will  have  dissolve?”

Since 2015, Heidi Binko   team   Just Transition Fund have worked with economic development agencies  nonprofits  areas where  coal industry once flourished. That  mean helping  local organization identify  write  grant  provide  matching grant.

The fund  created   Rockefeller Family Foundation  Appalachian Funders Network  help coal towns capture some   dollars provided   2015 Clean Power Plan,  POWER Act, passed during  Obama administration. Since then,  fund says   helped coal communities  West Virginia  throughout  nation secure more than $2 billion  federal grants.

Binko hopes  fund  continue  attract federal resources  towns with high poverty rates.

“There  still federal dollars available,”  said. “They haven’  been zeroed .”

The recently passed domestic policy bill,  instance, contains $50 billion  health care grants over 10 years  rural providers, though   unclear whether that money will keep hospitals  clinics that rely  Medicaid dollars afloat.

Two hallmarks   Biden administration’ infrastructure  stimulus acts — transitioning away from  carbon-based economy  providing federal resources among different populations equitably —    focus   Trump plan. As  result, Binko fears recent progress will  dimmed.

For instance, Generation West Virginia,  Just Transition Fund grantee worked with McDowell County  apply  funds from  Biden administration’ Digital Equity Act    elementary  middle school digital literacy program. Programs under   were terminated  May.

The cancellation   Digital Equity Act   setback  McDowell, where 20 percent  households ’ have  broadband internet connection, according   Generation West Virginia report.

Other, more basic infrastructure  lacking   county. According  DigDeep,  nonprofit that assists with clean water access  wastewater systems   primarily funded  private institutions, corporate partners  grassroots donations, there   hundreds  people   county without  dependable water supply. The exact number  unknown because information  whether existing water systems provide safe drinking water   gathered   U.S. Census.

DigDeep works with  McDowell Public Service District utility provider  identify residents  need  water hookup  helps secure grants from  U.S. Department  Agriculture’ rural development program  extend water trunk lines  hard--reach areas. In some cases,  nonprofit helps   connect  federally supported water lines directly  people’ homes. It  also helping  install wastewater treatment facilities  more than 400 residents  either have inadequate systems  flush waste into nearby creeks.

The water supply throughout  county  unreliable because   area’ close historical ties   rise  fall   coal economy, said George McGraw, DigDeep’ chief executive.

When coal operations came  McDowell, businesses operated   “closed loop” environment. Coal companies paid workers  build  work   mines, they owned  houses where miners lived,  they built  water lines that served those houses, McGraw said.

When  coal industry began  peter , companies exited  county, leaving behind  aging system  pipes  drains.

To secure water   county today, hundreds  people fill plastic jugs from roadside springs  mine shafts, McGraw said. To  drinking water, they    bathroom   store,  neighbor’ house,   school.

DigDeep  several projects   planning stages  McDowell. But  Trump USDA budget proposal would chop  rural water program  -thirds, meaning some public works projects  never  completed. Someone else will have  foot  bill   system will continue  crumble, leaving many people  McDowell County without  basic necessity.

“It’  like  burden goes away,” McGraw said. “The burden just shifts,  utilities  forced  raise rates  customers, many  whom  below  poverty line.”

In  early days   second term, President Donald Trump froze,   threatened    huge range  social services programs from public safety  early childhood education  food assistance  services  refugee resettlement. Staffing cuts  federal agencies have also contributed  delays  uncertainty around future grant funds. Altogether,  policies  poised  upend decades  partnerships  federal government  built with nonprofits  help people  their communities.

This vast  interconnected   programs funded  taxpayers  been significantly dismantled  just months, nonprofit leaders, researchers  funders . And even deeper, permanent cuts  still possible. That uncertainty  also taking  toll  their staff  communities,  leaders said.

In response  questions about  cuts  grant funding, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, “Instead  government largesse that’ often riddled with corruption, waste, fraud,  abuse,  Trump administration  focused  unleashing America’ economic resurgence  fuel Americans’ individual generosity.”

He pointed    deduction  charitable giving included   recently passed   spending  that  said encourages Americans’ “innate altruism.”

But experts  private donations will   enough  meet  needs.

In 2021, $267 billion  granted  nonprofits from  levels  government, according   analysis   Urban Institute published  February. While  data includes -exempt organizations like local food pantries  well  universities  nonprofit hospitals,  underestimates  total funding that nonprofits receive from  government. It includes grants,   contracts  services  reimbursements from programs like Medicare. It also excludes  smallest nonprofits, which file  different, abbreviated  form.

However,  figure does give  sense   scale   historic — , until , solid — relationship between  public sector  nonprofits over  last 50 years. Now, this system   risk  leaders like Price   cost  undoing  will  “catastrophic.”

The Urban Institute’ analysis shows more than half  nonprofits  every state received government grants  2021.

In  vast majority   country,  typical nonprofit would   deficit without government funding. Only   Congressional districts —  including parts  Orange County, California,  another   suburbs west  Atlanta — would  typical nonprofit       they lost   their public grant funding,  analysis found.

But  Orange County, famous   stunning beaches, mansions  extraordinary wealth, funders, nonprofits  researchers said that finding surprised them. In part, that' because  major economic inequalities   county   high cost  living.

Taryn Palumbo, executive director  Orange County Grantmakers, said nonprofits    optimistic about their resiliency.

“They  seeing their budgets getting slashed  50%  40%,”  said. “Or they’ having  look  restructure programs that they  running   they’ serving   number  people that they’ serving.”

Last year,  local Samueli Foundation commissioned  study  nonprofit needs  part because they were significantly increasing their grantmaking from $18.8 million  2022   estimated $125 million  2025. They found local nonprofits reported problems maintaining staff,  deep lack  investment  their operations   dearth  flexible reserve funds.

The foundation responded  opening applications  both unrestricted grants   support investments  buildings  land. Against this $10 million  potential awards, they received 1,242 applications  more than $250 million, said Lindsey Spindle,  foundation’ president.

“It tells  really stark picture   unbelievably deep  broad  need ,” Spindle said. “There    single part   nonprofit sector that   responded  these funds. Every topic   think : poverty, animal welfare, arts  culture, civil rights, domestic abuse... They’ telling  loud  clear that they  struggling  stay alive.”

One   founding stories   United States   importance   voluntary sector,  neighbors helping neighbors   individuals solving social problems. While other liberal democracies built strong welfare states,  U.S.  preferred  look   charitable sector  provide  substantial part  social services.

Since  1960s,  federal government  largely funded those social services  giving money  nonprofits, universities, hospitals  companies. Several  policies converged  that time  create this system, including  expansion   federal income  during World War II   codification  -exempt charitable organizations  1954. Then,  Kennedy  Johnson administrations started  fund nonprofits directly with federal money  part  urban renewal  Great Society programs.

“It    approach  midcentury liberalism  addressing issues  poverty, sort  making  reference  civil rights  racial inequality,   growing  size  government,” said Claire Dunning,  assistant professor  public policy   University  Maryland, College Park. Conservatives also tended  support working through local, private, nonprofit organizations, though  different reasons than liberals,  said.

With various expansions  cuts during different presidencies,  federal government  continued  fund nonprofits  significant levels, essentially hiding  government  plain sight, Dunning said. The size  importance   nonprofit apparatus became suddenly visible  January when  Trump administration sought  freeze federal grants  loans.

Dunning said  speed, hostility  scale   proposed cuts broke with  long legacy  bipartisan support  nonprofits.

“People   idea that  public health information  services they  receiving, their Meals  Wheels program, their afterschool tutoring program,  local park cleanup were actually enabled  public government dollars,”  said.

A coalition  nonprofits challenged  freeze  court   case that  ongoing,     months since,  administration  , paused  discontinued  vast array  programs  grants. The impacts  some  those policy changes have been felt immediately,  many will    ground until current grant funding runs , which could   months  years depending   programs.

Friendship Shelter  Laguna Beach   annual budget  about $15 million, $11.5 million  which comes from government sources. Price said  government funding  “braided”  complex ways  house  support 330 people. They' already lost  rental reimbursement grant from  U.S. Department  Housing  Urban Development. But  Samueli Foundation stepped   backfill those lost funds  three years.

That kind  support  extremely unusual,  said.

“We ’ know   large-scale private philanthropy response  keeping people housed because ’  forever commitment,” Price said. “That person   housing   going  need  subsidy   rest  their lives. These  seriously disabled people with multiple issues that they’ facing that they need help with.”

She also believes that even   wealthy place like Orange County, private donors   prepared  give five,   eight times  much  they  currently. Donors already subsidize their government grants, which  said   69%   actual program costs.

“We  providing this service   government   loss,   business loss,  then making  that loss with these Medicaid dollars  also  private fundraising,”  said.

She said  organization  discussed having   people   housing back    streets   government funding   further.

“That would , I think,  signal   that something  deeply, deeply wrong with  ’ looking  these issues,” said Price, adding, “If I  placing  , I would  that  have enough good still  government  prevent that.”

NEW YORK -- When  “KissCam”   Coldplay concert landed   couple  tried ( failed)  duck    spotlight,  internet immediately   work.

In hours,  clip  just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos  photos   pair' shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed  identify    camera. Artificial intelligence  software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that  CEO  chief people officer were  fact  couple   video —  announced  CEO' resignation over  weekend.

The incident' fallout ,  course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability   repercussions that conflicts  interest among leadership  cause. But there  also broader implications  play   increasingly online world — about  state  potentially being visible everywhere    tracked through “social media surveillance." Experts  ' more  more common  moments that  have been intended   private,   least reserved   single physical venue,  make their  online  even  global today.

So     lightning-fast social sharing  when cameras  practically inescapable, does being  public hold  expectation  privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder   world  ?

It'  secret that cameras  filming much   lives these days.

From CCTV security systems  Ring doorbells, businesses, schools  neighborhoods  ample video surveillance around  clock. Sporting  concert venues have also filmed fans  years, often projecting playful bits  audience participation   rest   crowd. In short,  -scene viewer becomes part   product —   center  attention.

And  course, consumers  record just about anything  they have  smartphone  their pocket — ,  ' enticing  other social media users, that footage  quickly spread through cyberspace.

Ellis Cashmore, author   book “Celebrity Culture,” proposes that  rapid fame  last week’ KissCam moment probably answers  question many have been asking  years: “Is  private life still what  ? And  answer ,  course, there’  such thing   private life anymore,”  notes. “Certainly    traditional sense   term.”

“I’  sure that   assume privacy   concert with hundreds  other people,” adds Mary Angela Bock,  associate professor   University  Texas  Austin’ School  Journalism  Media. “We ’ assume privacy   street anymore.”

Some version   KissCam  long been  staple   events — from timeouts during sports games  romantic songs played  artists  their concerts. It’ easy  miss,  most venues have signs  inform  audience that they could  filmed during  event. What’ been different  more recent years, experts note,   quickly those moments  travel beyond  physical space where they actually unfold.

That ’ only limited  what shows    jumbotron. Sometimes  only takes  person   crowd  capture  interaction  their phone  post  video online — where    around  world.

“It’  just  camera," Bock says. “It’  distribution system that  wild  .”

Then there'  second ring  exposure — what happens after  video  photos spread.

Experts point  growing instances  social media users rushing  publicly identify,  ,  people captured  camera — much like  quickly  internet committed  finding those involved   Coldplay moment,  example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both  Astronomer’ -former CEO  chief people officer remained disabled  Monday,  The Associated Press could  reach either  comment.

But  ' limited  company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting  familiar face  spreading  word, technological advances — including AI — have made  easier  faster overall  find just about anyone   online post. This  happen with videos  photos shared  social media each , even   doesn'  viral, experts warn.

“It’  little  unsettling  easily    identified with biometrics,   faces  online,  social media  track  —    internet  gone from being  place  interaction,   gigantic surveillance system," Bock says. “When  think about ,   being surveilled   social media. They’ tracking   exchange  entertaining .”

And  course, such moments  also impact people  were  actually  camera. As easy       identified online today,  internet  notorious  cutting  broad swath   always getting  right. That sometimes produces harassment  individuals  actually involved.

At last week' Coldplay concert,  example, many social media users speculated that  third person seen near   caught  camera  another Astronomer employee — leading  swarms  posts targeting . But  company later confirmed that      event  said  other employees were   video circulating online.

For  -viral moment, “  talk about what’ right  wrong,  whether they deserved ,” says Alison Taylor,  clinical associate professor  New York University’ Stern School  Business. Still, ’  “very frightening thing      abuse  harassment online,” Taylor notes. “There  real human beings behind this.”

It’ hard  think that that these kind  viral moments will ever  away —  there   legal restrictions  stop users from sharing clips  interactions recorded from anything from  concert   street widely online. But   individual level, Bock says    helpful  “think before  share”  question whether something’ really accurate.

“Social media  changed  much,” Bock says. “But  really have ,   society, caught  with  technology  terms   ethics   etiquette.”

As artificial intelligence technology becomes part  daily life, adolescents  turning  chatbots  advice, guidance  conversation. The appeal  clear: Chatbots  patient, never judgmental, supportive  always available.

That worries experts    booming AI industry  largely unregulated  that many parents have  idea about  their kids  using AI tools   extent  personal information they  sharing with chatbots.

New research shows more than 70%  American teenagers have used AI companions  more than half converse with them regularly. The study  Common Sense Media focused  “AI companions,” like Character. AI, Nomi  Replika, which  defines  “digital friends  characters   text  talk with whenever  want,” versus AI assistants  tools like ChatGPT, though  notes they   used  same .

It’ important that parents understand  technology. Experts suggest some things parents    help protect their kids:

— Start  conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher  Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity  basic questions: “Have  heard  AI companions?” “Do   apps that talk   like  friend?” Listen  understand what appeals  your teen before being dismissive  saying ’ worried about .

— Help teens recognize that AI companions  programmed   agreeable  validating. Explain that’   real relationships work  that real friends with their  points  view  help navigate difficult situations  ways that AI companions cannot.

“One   things that' really concerning   only what' happening  screen   much time ’ taking kids away from relationships  real life,” says Mitch Prinstein, chief  psychology   American Psychological Association. “We need  teach kids that this   form  entertainment. It'  real,  ' really important they distinguish  from reality  should  have  replace relationships  your actual life.”

The APA recently    health advisory  AI  adolescent well-being,  tips  parents.

— Parents should watch  signs  unhealthy attachments.

“If your teen  preferring AI interactions over real relationships  spending hours talking  AI companions,  showing that they  becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them — those  patterns that suggest AI companions might  replacing rather than complementing human connection,” Robb says.

— Parents   rules about AI , just like they   screen time  social media. Have discussions about when   AI tools   cannot  used. Many AI companions  designed  adult    mimic romantic, intimate  role-playing scenarios.

While AI companions  feel supportive, children should understand  tools   equipped  handle  real crisis  provide genuine mental health support. If kids  struggling with depression, anxiety, loneliness,  eating disorder  other mental health challenges, they need human support — whether   family, friends   mental health professional.

— Get informed. The more parents know about AI,  better. “I ' think people quite  what AI  ,  many teens  using    ' starting    little scary,” says Prinstein,   many experts calling  regulations  ensure safety guardrails  children. “A    throw  hands   , ‘I ’ know what this !' This sounds crazy!' Unfortunately, that tells kids   have  problem with this, ' come   because I  going  diminish   belittle .”

Older teenagers have advice, ,  parents  kids. Banning AI tools    solution because  technology  becoming ubiquitous, says Ganesh Nair, 18.

“Trying    AI  like trying    social media today. It   ingrained  everything  ,” says Nair,   trying  step back from using AI companions after seeing them affect real-life friendships   high school. “The best      regulate    embrace being challenged.”

“Anything that  difficult, AI  make easy. But that   problem,” says Nair. “Actively seek  challenges, whether academic  personal. If  fall   idea that easier  better, then    most vulnerable  being absorbed into this newly artificial world.”

An artificial intelligence agenda that started coalescing   podcasts  Silicon Valley billionaires   being forged into U.S. policy  President Donald Trump leans   ideas   tech figures  backed  election campaign.

Trump  Wednesday  planning  reveal  “AI Action Plan”  ordered after returning   White House  January. He gave  tech advisers  months  come  with  AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden' signature AI guardrails   first   office.

The unveiling  -hosted   bipartisan Hill  Valley Forum   All-In Podcast,  business  technology show hosted  four tech investors  entrepreneurs  include Trump’ AI czar, David Sacks.

The plan  related executive orders  expected  include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating  sale  AI technology abroad  making  easier  construct  energy-hungry data center buildings that  needed  form   AI products, according   person briefed  Wednesday’ event    authorized  speak publicly  spoke  condition  anonymity.

It might also include some   AI culture  preoccupations   circle  venture capitalists  endorsed Trump last year.

Countering  liberal bias they   AI chatbots such  ChatGPT  Google' Gemini  long been  rallying point   tech industry' loudest Trump backers.

Sacks,  former PayPal executive   Trump'  AI adviser,  been criticizing “woke AI”  more than  year, fueled  Google' February 2024 rollout   AI image generator that, when asked  show  American Founding Father, created pictures  Black, Latino  Native American .

“The AI’ incapable  giving  accurate answers because ’ been  programmed with diversity  inclusion,” Sacks said   time. Google quickly fixed  tool,   “Black George Washington” moment remained  parable   problem  AI' perceived political bias, taken   X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance  Republican lawmakers.

The administration’ latest push against “woke AI” comes  week after  Pentagon announced  $200 million contracts with four leading AI companies, including Google,  address “critical national security challenges.”

Also receiving    contracts  Musk’ xAI, which  been pitched   alternative  “woke AI” companies. The company  faced   challenges: Earlier this month, xAI   scramble  remove posts made   Grok chatbot that made antisemitic comments  praised Adolf Hitler.

Trump  paired AI' need  huge amounts  electricity with   push   into U.S. energy sources, including , coal  nuclear.

“Everything  aspire   hope  means  demand  supply  energy  America    ,” said Michael Kratsios,  director   White House' Office  Science  Technology Policy,   video posted Tuesday.

Many tech giants  already well  their  toward building  data centers   U.S.  around  world. OpenAI announced this week that   switched   first phase   massive data center complex  Abilene, Texas, part   Oracle-backed project known  Stargate that Trump promoted earlier this year. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta  xAI also have major projects underway.

The tech industry  pushed  easier permitting rules   their computing facilities connected  power,   AI building boom  also contributed  spiking demand  fossil fuel production that will contribute  global warming.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  Tuesday called   world’ major tech firms  power data centers completely with renewables  2030.

“A typical AI data center eats   much electricity  100,000 homes,” Guterres said. “By 2030, data centers could consume  much electricity    Japan does today.”

It' long been White House policy under Republican  Democratic administrations  curtail certain technology exports  China  other adversaries  national security grounds.

But much   tech industry argued that Biden went        term  trying  restrict  exports  specialized AI computer chips  more than 100 other countries, including close allies.

Part   Biden administration' motivation   stop China from acquiring coveted AI chips  third-party locations such  Southeast Asia   Middle East,  critics said  measures would   encouraging more countries  turn  China' fast-growing AI industry instead   U.S.  their technology supplier.

It remains   seen   Trump administration aims  accelerate  export  U.S.-made AI technologies while countering China' AI ambitions. California chipmakers Nvidia  AMD both announced last week that they  approval from  Trump administration  sell  China some  their advanced computer chips used  develop artificial intelligence.

AMD CEO Lisa Su  among  guests planning  attend Trump' event Wednesday.

There  sharp debates    regulate AI, even among  influential venture capitalists  have been debating   their favorite medium:  podcast.

While some Trump backers, particularly Andreessen, have advocated  “accelerationist” approach that aims  speed  AI advancement with minimal regulation, Sacks  described himself  taking  middle road  techno-realism.

“Technology  going  happen. Trying  stop   like ordering  tides  stop. If  ’  , somebody else will,” Sacks said   All-In podcast.

On Tuesday, 95 groups including labor unions, parent groups, environmental justice organizations  privacy advocates signed  resolution opposing Trump’ embrace  industry-driven AI policy  calling   “People’ AI Action Plan” that would “deliver first  foremost   American people.”

Amba Kak, -executive director   AI Now Institute, which helped lead  effort, said  coalition expects Trump’ plan  come “straight from Big Tech’ mouth.”

“Every time  , ‘What about  jobs,  , water,  children?’ they’ going  , ‘But what about China?’”  said   call with reporters Tuesday. She said Americans should reject  White House’ argument that  industry  overregulated  fight  preserve “baseline protections   public”  AI technology advances.

No question   small when Kayla Chege,  high school student  Kansas,  using artificial intelligence.

The 15-year- asks ChatGPT  guidance  back--school shopping, makeup colors, -calorie choices  Smoothie King, plus ideas   Sweet 16   younger sister’ birthday party.

The sophomore honors student makes  point   have chatbots   homework  tries  limit  interactions  mundane questions. But  interviews with The Associated Press    study, teenagers  they  increasingly interacting with AI    were  companion, capable  providing advice  friendship.

“Everyone uses AI  everything . It’ really taking over,” said Chege,  wonders  AI tools will affect  generation. “I think kids  AI     thinking.”

For  past couple  years, concerns about cheating  school have dominated  conversation around kids  AI. But artificial intelligence  playing  much larger role  many  their lives. AI, teens ,  become  - source  personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making  problem-solving.

More than 70%  teens have used AI companions  half  them regularly, according    study from Common Sense Media,  group that studies  advocates  using screens  digital media sensibly.

The study defines AI companions  platforms designed  serve  “digital friends,” like Character.AI  Replika, which   customized with specific traits  personalities   offer emotional support, companionship  conversations that  feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT  Claude, which mainly answer questions,  being used   same ,  researchers .

As  technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers  experts worry about AI’ potential  redefine human relationships  exacerbate crises  loneliness  youth mental health.

“AI  always available. It never gets bored with . It’ never judgmental,” says Ganesh Nair,  18-year-  Arkansas. “When ’ talking  AI,   always right. You’ always interesting. You  always emotionally justified.”

All that used   appealing,   Nair heads  college this fall,  wants  step back from using AI. Nair  spooked after  high school friend  relied   “AI companion”  heart--heart conversations with  girlfriend later   chatbot write  breakup text ending  -year relationship.

“That felt  little  dystopian, that  computer generated     real relationship,” said Nair. “It’ almost like   allowing computers  replace  relationships with people.”

In  Common Sense Media survey, 31%  teens said their conversations with AI companions were “ satisfying  more satisfying” than talking with real friends. Even though half  teens said they distrust AI' advice, 33%  discussed serious  important issues with AI instead  real people.

Those findings  worrisome, says Michael Robb,  study’ lead author  head researcher  Common Sense,  should send  warning  parents, teachers  policymakers. The -booming  largely unregulated AI industry  becoming  integrated with adolescence  smartphones  social media .

“It’ -opening,” said Robb. “When      this survey,    understanding   many kids  actually using AI companions.” The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide  April  May.

Adolescence   critical time  developing identity, social skills  independence, Robb said,  AI companions should complement —  replace — real-world interactions.

“If teens  developing social skills  AI platforms where they  constantly being validated,  being challenged,  learning  read social cues  understand somebody else’ perspective, they   going   adequately prepared   real world,”  said.

The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions   “ risk assessment,” finding ineffective  restrictions  that  platforms  produce sexual material, give dangerous advice  offer harmful content. The group recommends that minors   AI companions.

Researchers  educators worry about  cognitive costs  youth  rely heavily  AI, especially  their creativity, critical thinking  social skills. The potential dangers  children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when  14-year- Florida  died  suicide after developing  emotional attachment   Character.AI chatbot.

“Parents really have  idea this  happening,” said Eva Telzer,  psychology  neuroscience professor   University  North Carolina  Chapel Hill. “All    struck   quickly this blew .” Telzer  leading multiple studies  youth  AI,   research area with limited data.

Telzer’ research  found that children  young  8  using generative AI  also found that teens  using AI  explore their sexuality   companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that     apps teens frequent  SpicyChat AI,  free role-playing  intended  adults.

Many teens also  they  chatbots  write emails  messages  strike  right tone  sensitive situations.

“One   concerns that comes   that they  longer have trust  themselves  make  decision,” said Telzer. “They need feedback from AI before feeling like they  check    that  idea  OK  .”

Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says  relates  that  relies  AI tools  craft outlines  proofread essays   English class.

“If  tell   plan   essay, I would think  going  ChatGPT before getting   pencil,” Perry said. He uses AI daily   asked chatbots  advice  social situations,  help  decide what  wear   write emails  teachers, saying AI articulates  thoughts faster.

Perry says  feels fortunate that AI companions were  around when   younger.

“I’ worried that kids could  lost  this,” Perry said. “I could    that grows  with AI  seeing  reason     park    make  friend.”

Other teens agree, saying  issues with AI   effect  children’ mental health  different from those  social media.

“Social media complemented  need people have   seen,   known,  meet  people,” Nair said. “I think AI complements another need that runs   deeper —  need  attachment   need  feel emotions. It feeds   that.”

“It’   addiction,” Nair added. “That’  I  .”

The financial world  buzzing about tokenization,  process using blockchain  turn real-world assets like stocks  real estate into digital tokens

'Please  careful.' There  risks  rewards  crypto heavyweights push tokenization

As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with  traditional financial system, industry heavyweights  racing   long-sought goal  turning real-world assets into digital tokens.

“Tokenization  going  open  door   massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev,  CEO   trading platform Robinhood   recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event   south  France.

Advocates  tokenization   next leap forward  crypto   help break down walls that have advantaged  wealthy  make trading cheaper, more transparent  more accessible  everyday investors.

But critics  tokenization threatens  undermine  century’ worth  securities   investor protections that have made  U.S. financial system  envy   world. And Robinhood’ push into tokenizing shares  private companies quickly faced pushback from    world’ most popular startups.

The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies  create digital tokens  stand-  things like bonds, real estate  even fractional ownership   piece    that   traded like crypto  virtually anyone, anywhere   time.

The massive growth  stablecoins, which   type  cryptocurrency typically bought  sold  $1,  helped fuel  appetite  tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said   recent podcast.

She said tokenization will upend investing  ways similar   streamers radically changed  people watch television.

“You used  have   there   Thursday night  watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune    specific time,  ’   choose your program,  couldn’  watching  program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix  market-expanding. In  same , I think  tokenization  real-world assets will  market expanding.”

Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading  major U.S. public companies   European customers earlier this month  gave away tokens  some customers meant  represent shares  OpenAI  SpaceX,  highly valued private companies.

Several other firms  diving . Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside  U.S.  trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase  petitioned regulators  open  market   U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock  Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion  2030.

The push  tokenization comes   heady time  crypto,  industry that’ seen enormous growth from  creation  early development  bitcoin more than 15 years   libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts   growing acceptance  mainstream finance.

The world’ most popular cryptocurrency   regularly setting -time highs — more than $123,000  Monday — while other forms  crypto like stablecoins  exploding     Trump administration  pledged  usher  what’ been called  “golden ”  digital assets.

Lee Reiners,  lecturing fellow  Duke University, said  biggest winners   push  tokenization could   small handful  exchanges like Robinhood that  their trading volumes  influence spike.

“Which  kind  ironic given  origins  crypto, which   bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said.

Interest  tokenization  also gotten  boost thanks   election  President Donald Trump,   made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations   priority   administration  signed    regulating stablecoins  Friday.

“Tokenization   innovation     SEC should  focused     advance innovation   marketplace,” said Securities  Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.

Securities    complex  even defining what   security    hotly debated question, particularly  crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings  tokenized securities  2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations  that country’ securities .

Under Trump,  SEC  taken  much less expansive view than  previous administration  dropped  paused litigation against crypto companies that  agency  previously accused  violating securities .

Hilary Allen,  professor   American University Washington College  Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened  Trump' victory   more aggressive  pushing what they  offer.

“The most pressing risk  (tokenization) being used   regulatory arbitrage play     getting around  rules,”  said.

However,  SEC  struck  cautionary tone when  comes  tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’ announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce,   been  outspoken crypto supporter, issued  statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal .

“As powerful  blockchain technology ,  does  have magical abilities  transform  nature   underlying asset,” Peirce said.

One   most closely watched areas  tokenization involves private companies, which aren’ subject  strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones.

Many  startups   going public  often  they used   instead  increasingly relying  wealthy  institutional investors  raise large sums  money  stay private.

That’ unfair   little ,  advocates  tokenization.

“These  massive wealth generators   very small group  rich, well-connected insiders   access  these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto   power  solve this inequality.”

But Robinhood’ giveaway  tokens meant  represent  investment  OpenAI immediately drew pushback from  company itself, which said    involved  Robinhood’ plan    endorse .

“Any transfer  OpenAI equity requires  approval—   approve  transfer,” OpenAI said  social media. “Please  careful.”

Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies ’ have  produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors  give  legitimacy   U.S. financial system, said Allen,  said  push  tokenized sales  shares  private companies  “eerily familiar”   things played  before  creation   SEC nearly  century .

“Where ’ headed  where  were   1920s,”  said. “Door--door salesmen offering stocks  bonds, half    nothing behind , people losing their life savings betting  stuff they didn’ understand.”

The company issued  alert  customers Saturday saying   aware   zero- exploit being used  conduct attacks  that   working  patch  issue. Microsoft updated  guidance Sunday with instructions    problem  SharePoint Server 2019  SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working      older SharePoint Server 2016 software.

“Anybody ’   hosted SharePoint server    problem,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president with CrowdStrike,  cybersecurity firm. “It’  significant vulnerability.”

Companies  government agencies around  world  SharePoint  internal document management, data organization  collaboration.

A zero- exploit   cyberattack that takes advantage   previously unknown security vulnerability. "Zero-" refers   fact that  security engineers have  zero days  develop     vulnerability.

According   U.S. Cybersecurity  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  exploit affecting SharePoint  " variant   existing vulnerability CVE-2025-49706  poses  risk  organizations with -premise SharePoint servers.”

Security researchers warn that  exploit, reportedly known  “ToolShell,”   serious    allow actors  fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected  SharePoint, such  Teams  OneDrive.

As global temperatures rise under climate change,  bees responsible  pollinating many crops  under increasing stress  scientists  trying  understand  they  affected

Bees have some ways  cope with warming Earth,  researchers fear  their future

WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes’ face under  beekeeper’ veil   hauls boxes  honeycomb from  hives   truck. It'  workout  what feels like  sauna   late-morning June temperatures rise.

Though Barnes  ,  bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures     27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than   around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists  trying  better understand  effects  managed  wild bees  they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey  reproduce.

They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating   hottest days  using fewer  harder wingbeats  keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according   study published last year. Scientists also  that bees — like people —  also cope  retreating   cooler environment such   shade  their nest.

“Just like   into  shade,   sweat   might work less hard, bees actually   exact same thing  they  avoid  heat,” said Jon Harrison,  environmental physiologist  Arizona State University     study’ authors.

But that means  bees aren' able   what they normally , said Kevin McCluney,  biology professor  Bowling Green State University.

“They’  going   getting more nectar. They’  mating. They’  doing  things that bees would otherwise ,” McCluney said.

Generally, most bees  heat-tolerant,    climate warms, some experts think their ability  fend  disease  gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased   pesticides, diseases  lack  forage  both managed  wild bees   listed  potential contributors   global decline  bees  other pollinators.

“If '  well-,  your body  intoxicated with pesticides   have lots  diseases  your body, ' going   less heat-tolerant than   were healthy,” said Margarita López-Uribe,  pollinator health expert  Pennsylvania State University.

Earlier this year, preliminary results from  annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56%  their managed colonies,  highest loss since  survey started  2010.

Almost    managed honeybee colonies   U.S.  used  pollinate agricultural crops such  almonds, apples, cherries  blueberries. Fewer pollinators  lead  less pollination  potentially lower yields.

“It'  very fragile system   think about ,” López-Uribe said. “Because  something goes wrong,  have these super high-value crops that ’  enough bees  pollination.”

Back  Barnes' hives  Ohio, thousands  honeybees  around   gathers boxes  take back   farm  honey production. Nearby,  couple   bees land  milkweed flowers,  rare   plant diversity   area dominated  corn  soybean fields.

For Barnes,  operates Honeyrun Farm with  wife, Jayne,    challenges heat  pose   500 honeybee hives  fending  parasitic mites that threaten  bees. If temperatures   ,  ’ apply formic acid,  organic chemical that kills  mites. If ’ applied when ’  ,  bees could .

Last year they lost almost  third   400 hives they sent  California  help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives  have been  poor health ahead  pollination because they were unable  ward  mites when    months earlier.

“Dead hives aren’ pollinating  almonds,”  said. “It’  real ripple effect that stems back from  heat   summertime.”

Sometimes  heat helps. Here  Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced  bumper crop  honey  they feasted  nearby soybean nectar   plants bloomed   heat. Still,  lack  diverse plants  bees  forage   area dominated  corn  soybean fields ' ideal.

LONDON -- When  schoolboy going    found  ribs   wooden ship poking through  dunes   remote Scottish beach,  sparked  hunt  archaeologists, scientists  local historians  uncover  story.

Through    high-tech science  community research, they have  answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that  vessel  very likely  Earl  Chatham,  18th-century warship that  action   American War  Independence before  second life hunting whales   Arctic —  then  stormy demise.

“I would regard    lucky ship, which   strange thing   about  ship that’ wrecked,” said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist  Wessex Archaeology,  charity that helped community researchers conduct  investigation.

“I think    been found  many other places,  wouldn’ necessarily have  that community drive, that desire  recover  study that material,  also  community spirit   ,” Saunders said.

The wreck  discovered  February 2024 after  storm swept away sand covering   Sanday,    rugged Orkney Islands that   Scotland’ northern .

It excited interest   island  500 people, whose history  bound  with     dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around  20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since  15th century.

Local farmers used their tractors  trailers  haul  12 tons   timbers   beach, before local researchers   work trying  identify .

“That  really good ,    such  good feeling about  community – everybody pulling together    back,” said Sylvia Thorne,    island’ community researchers. “Quite   people  really getting interested    becoming experts.”

Dendrochronology —  science  dating wood from tree rings — showed  timber came from southern England   middle   18th century. That     luck, Saunders said, because  coincides with “ point where British bureaucracy’ really starting  kick ”  detailed records were being kept.

“And    then start  look   archive evidence that  have   wrecks  Orkney,” Saunders said. “It becomes  process  elimination.

“You remove ones that  Northern European  opposed  British,  remove wrecks that   small  operating    north  England   really  down    three …  Earl  Chatham   last  left.”

Further research found that before    Earl  Chatham,  ship  HMS Hind,  24- Royal Navy frigate built  Chichester  England’ south coast  1749.

Its military career   play  part   expansion —  contraction —   British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control  Canada from France during  sieges  Louisbourg  Quebec   1750s,    1770s served   convoy escort during Britain’ failed effort  hold onto  American colonies.

A year later, while heading    whaling ground,   wrecked   weather  Sanday. All 56 crew members survived — more evidence, Saunders says, that this   vessel blessed with luck.

“The community have been  keen, have been  desirous   involved   find  things  learn,  they’  proud  . It’ down  them   discovered, ’ down  them   recovered  ’ been stabilized  been protected,”  said.

MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases  opposite coasts Monday, raising  question about  billionaire that could either speed  plan   self-driving Teslas  U.S. roads  throw   major roadblock: Can this wildly successful   tends  exaggerate really  trusted?

In Miami,  Tesla driver   admitted   wrong  reach   dropped cell phone moments before  deadly accident, spoke   danger  putting  much faith  Musk' technology —  this case  Autopilot program.

“I trusted  technology  much,” said George McGee,     road  killed  woman  stargazing with  boyfriend. “I believed that     something  front  ,  would provide  warning  apply  brakes.”

In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing  Oakland, California, case tried   exaggerated talk about  same Tesla technology   center   request  suspend  carmaker from being able  sell vehicles   state.

Musk' tendency  talk  — whether '  cars,  rockets   government costing-cutting efforts — have landed   trouble with investors, regulators  courts before,  rarely  such  delicate moment.

After  social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk   longer count   light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales   electric cars have plunged       safety reputation could threaten  next  project: rolling  driverless robotaxis — hundreds  thousands  them —  several U.S. cities     next year.

The Miami case holds other dangers, . Lawyers   family   dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced  judge overseeing  jury trial  allow them  argue  punitive damages. A  crash lawyer  involved   case,  closely following , said that could cost Tesla tens  millions  dollars,  possibly more.

“I’ seen punitive damages    hundreds  millions,  that   floor,” said Miguel Custodio  Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. “It  also  signal  other plaintiffs that they  also   punitive damages,  then  payments could start compounding.”

That Tesla  allowed  Miami case  proceed  trial  surprising. It  settled  least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week   Florida family   Tesla driver. That said, Tesla  victorious   other jury cases, both  California, that also sought   blame   technology  crashes.

Lawyers   plaintiffs   Miami case argue that Tesla’ driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned  driver  braked when  Model S sedan blew through flashing lights,  stop sign   T-intersection  62 miles--hour   April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers  warned   rely  Autopilot,   more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says  fault entirely lies with  "distracted driver" just like  many other “accidents since cellphones were invented.”

Driver McGee settled  separate suit brought   family  Benavides   severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.

McGee  clearly shaken when shown  dashcam video Monday    jumping  Key West, Florida, road  hitting  parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides  sent  75 feet through     death. Asked    seen those images before, McGee pinched  lips, shook  head, then squeaked   response, “No.”

Tesla' attorney sought  show that McGee  fully  blame, asking    ever contacted Tesla  additional instructions about  Autopilot   other safety features worked. McGee said   , though   heavy user   features. He said   driven  same road home from work 30  40 times. Under questioning,  also acknowledged  alone  responsible  watching  road  hitting  brakes.

Summarizing  testimony, Tesla said   statement after  court adjourned that McGee  "stated  simple truth that   know: If   just paid attention   road instead  searching   dropped cell phone  pressing  accelerator —which   doing  over  minute before  crash — this tragic accident would never have happened.”

But lawyers   Benavides family   chance   courtroom  parrying that line  argument, asking McGee   would have taken  eyes   road  reached   phone   been driving   other than  Tesla  Autopilot.

McGee responded, “I ’ believe .”

The case  expected  continue   more weeks.

In  California case,  state' Department  Motor Vehicles  arguing before  administrative judge that Tesla  misled drivers  exaggerating  capabilities   Autopilot  Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names  misleading because they offer just partial self-driving

Musk  been warned  federal regulators  stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows  cars  drive themselves because  could lead  overreliance   system, resulting  possible crashes  deaths. He also   into trouble with regulators  Autopilot. In 2023,  company   recall 2.3 million vehicles  problems with  technology    under investigation  saying  fixed  issue though ’ unclear  , according  regulatory documents.

The California case  expected  last another four days.

MOSCOW -- Russian lawmakers  Tuesday approved  bill that punishes online searches  information that  deemed “extremist,”  latest move  government authorities  their relentless crackdown  dissent.

The bill passed   lower house,  State Duma, moves   --certain endorsement   upper house  then goes  President Vladimir Putin   signed into .

The legislation punishes what  describes  “deliberately searching   accessing extremist materials” online. First-time offenders face  fine     equivalent  $64.

The official definition  extremist activity  extremely broad  includes opposition groups like  Anti-Corruption Foundation, created   late opposition leader Alexei Navalny,   “international LGBT movement.”

It’  clear  authorities will track down violators. Officials  lawmakers said ordinary internet users '  affected  only those  methodically seek outlawed content will  targeted. They didn' explain   authorities would differentiate between them.

Some observers have suggested  information would likely come from internet providers  social media platforms,  police also could randomly check  search history  cellphones  computers.

NEW YORK -- When  “KissCam”   Coldplay concert landed   couple  tried ( failed)  duck    spotlight,  internet immediately   work.

In hours,  clip  just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos  photos   pair' shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed  identify    camera. Artificial intelligence  software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that  CEO  chief people officer were  fact  couple   video —  announced  CEO' resignation over  weekend.

The incident' fallout ,  course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability   repercussions that conflicts  interest among leadership  cause. But there  also broader implications  play   increasingly online world — about  state  potentially being visible everywhere    tracked through “social media surveillance." Experts  ' more  more common  moments that  have been intended   private,   least reserved   single physical venue,  make their  online  even  global today.

So     lightning-fast social sharing  when cameras  practically inescapable, does being  public hold  expectation  privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder   world  ?

It'  secret that cameras  filming much   lives these days.

From CCTV security systems  Ring doorbells, businesses, schools  neighborhoods  ample video surveillance around  clock. Sporting  concert venues have also filmed fans  years, often projecting playful bits  audience participation   rest   crowd. In short,  -scene viewer becomes part   product —   center  attention.

And  course, consumers  record just about anything  they have  smartphone  their pocket — ,  ' enticing  other social media users, that footage  quickly spread through cyberspace.

Ellis Cashmore, author   book “Celebrity Culture,” proposes that  rapid fame  last week’ KissCam moment probably answers  question many have been asking  years: “Is  private life still what  ? And  answer ,  course, there’  such thing   private life anymore,”  notes. “Certainly    traditional sense   term.”

“I’  sure that   assume privacy   concert with hundreds  other people,” adds Mary Angela Bock,  associate professor   University  Texas  Austin’ School  Journalism  Media. “We ’ assume privacy   street anymore.”

Some version   KissCam  long been  staple   events — from timeouts during sports games  romantic songs played  artists  their concerts. It’ easy  miss,  most venues have signs  inform  audience that they could  filmed during  event. What’ been different  more recent years, experts note,   quickly those moments  travel beyond  physical space where they actually unfold.

That ’ only limited  what shows    jumbotron. Sometimes  only takes  person   crowd  capture  interaction  their phone  post  video online — where    around  world.

“It’  just  camera," Bock says. “It’  distribution system that  wild  .”

Then there'  second ring  exposure — what happens after  video  photos spread.

Experts point  growing instances  social media users rushing  publicly identify,  ,  people captured  camera — much like  quickly  internet committed  finding those involved   Coldplay moment,  example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both  Astronomer’ -former CEO  chief people officer remained disabled  Monday,  The Associated Press could  reach either  comment.

But  ' limited  company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting  familiar face  spreading  word, technological advances — including AI — have made  easier  faster overall  find just about anyone   online post. This  happen with videos  photos shared  social media each , even   doesn'  viral, experts warn.

“It’  little  unsettling  easily    identified with biometrics,   faces  online,  social media  track  —    internet  gone from being  place  interaction,   gigantic surveillance system," Bock says. “When  think about ,   being surveilled   social media. They’ tracking   exchange  entertaining .”

And  course, such moments  also impact people  were  actually  camera. As easy       identified online today,  internet  notorious  cutting  broad swath   always getting  right. That sometimes produces harassment  individuals  actually involved.

At last week' Coldplay concert,  example, many social media users speculated that  third person seen near   caught  camera  another Astronomer employee — leading  swarms  posts targeting . But  company later confirmed that      event  said  other employees were   video circulating online.

For  -viral moment, “  talk about what’ right  wrong,  whether they deserved ,” says Alison Taylor,  clinical associate professor  New York University’ Stern School  Business. Still, ’  “very frightening thing      abuse  harassment online,” Taylor notes. “There  real human beings behind this.”

It’ hard  think that that these kind  viral moments will ever  away —  there   legal restrictions  stop users from sharing clips  interactions recorded from anything from  concert   street widely online. But   individual level, Bock says    helpful  “think before  share”  question whether something’ really accurate.

“Social media  changed  much,” Bock says. “But  really have ,   society, caught  with  technology  terms   ethics   etiquette.”

Wednesday’ magnitude 7.3 earthquake  Alaska’ Aleutian Islands chain struck   region that  experienced  handful  powerful quakes within  last five years

Alaska   most earthquake-prone state. Here  .

JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday’ magnitude 7.3 earthquake  Alaska' Aleutian Islands chain struck   region that  experienced  handful  powerful quakes within  last five years — including  that shook communities almost exactly  years earlier.

Officials said Thursday they  received  reports  injuries  major damage from  latest event, which triggered  tsunami warning that lasted about  hour before being downgraded  prompted communities along  700-mile (1,127-) stretch  Alaska’ southern coast  urge people  move  higher ground. The official maximum wave height  Sand Point,  community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north   epicenter,  about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling,  lead duty scientist   National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred   tide.

The earthquake struck  12:37 .. local time, prompting  center' tsunami warning.

There   number  ways people  warning areas  receive notifications, including  sounding  sirens  communities that have them, listening  weather radio  public radio broadcasts, following official accounts  social media,   push alerts  cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door  door, said Jeremy Zidek,  spokesperson with  state' emergency management division.

Public safety departments  King Cove  Unalaska sent alerts urging those  coastal areas  those that could  inundation  seek higher ground.

The warning issued   center  downgraded   advisory before being canceled around 2:45 ..

“I would  call this  isolated earthquake. It appears   part   larger sequence spanning  last several years,"  said. But West added: “There'  reason   alarmist about this.”

Some communities have buildings designated  higher ground  meetup points during tsunami warnings, such   school, while others might simply urge residents  retreat   hillside, Zidek said.

“That area  Alaska, most areas  Alaska,  gets steep real quick,”  said.

TALLINN, Estonia -- A snappy tune   blogger that mockingly laments  poor internet connection   southern Russian city  Rostov--Don  gotten over  half-million views  Instagram   weeks.

“How   ’ from Rostov without saying  word? Show    cellphone service," Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around  city, smartphone  hand. "We have internet until 12 'clock,  recently there’ been  connection  . No need   angry, just  used   already.”

The complaints  Osipyan — unable   electronically  groceries,  having   paper maps while driving — aren' isolated  Rostov--Don, which borders Ukraine ,  home  Russia' Southern Military District,  targeted frequently  drones.

In  last  months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials   needed  foil Ukrainian drones, have  dozens  Russian regions — from those near  fighting  parts  Siberia  even  Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported.

Russians contacted  The Associated Press talked about card payments  going through, taxi  ride-sharing apps  working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail.

Experts point   unprecedented nature   measures  warn  -reaching consequences   country where  Kremlin already  significantly curtailed online freedom.

Such shutdowns   name  security legitimize them   public  open  door  authorities abusing  restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager  Eastern Europe  Central Asia   Access Now digital rights group.

Experts   trend began  May, when Russia celebrated  80th anniversary   defeat   Nazi Germany  World War II  foreign dignitaries flocked  Moscow    military parade.

The capital suffered severe disruptions  cellphone connectivity   internet  days,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions   regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked  long they' last,  replied, "This will  done  needed.”

Russia  restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests,  well   regions bordering Ukraine.

Shutdowns   capital, however, sent  signal  authorities across  vast country that ’  useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder  Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda.

Ukraine’ "Operation Spiderweb”  early June,  which drones launched from containers  trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials   more eager  take action, Darbinyan said.

“They  really scared that drones   appear, like  jack---,   Russian regions,”  told AP.

By -July, deliberate shutdowns spread  most   country, according  Na Svyazi — Russian  “staying connected” —  activist group tracking internet availability.

On Tuesday,  group reported cellphone internet shutdowns  73  over 80 regions. In 41  them, there were reports  broadband network outages  well, while restrictions  broadband internet occurred   regions, while cellphone connections were fine.

Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet  restricted  security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov. Gleb Nikitin said this month  measure will stay  place   region east  Moscow  “ long   threat remains.”

Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said “everything that    with ensuring  safety  citizens, everything  justified  everything   priority.”

Russians from affected regions   outages  last  hours  days; patterns also  hard  discern, with service working   part   city  vanishing elsewhere.

In Voronezh, near Ukraine  frequently targeted  drones,  resident said  felt like    “ cave”  early July with  cellphone internet  Wi-Fi   home. The woman,  spoke  AP  condition  anonymity because  security concerns, said   only able   online  work  next .

Connectivity  improved recently   Siberian city  Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko,  owns retail stores  other businesses there. But cellphone internet service     office   entire week. A    smaller stores that rely  cellphone networks suffered disruptions,  nothing critical,  said.

“I ’ feel  super strong discomfort," said Grigori Khromov  Nizhny Novgorod, Russia’ fifth-largest city where regular  widespread shutdowns were reported. "I have  office   I work either  home    office  have either wire internet  Wi-Fi.”

In rural areas, small towns  villages, where cellphone internet often   only    online,  situation  harder  gauge.

Pharmacies  such areas have struggled, Russian media reported   Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed  AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head   association, said   statement that prescriptions must  logged  special software,  that becomes impossible without  internet connection  weeks.

A social media user   Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained  Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov’ social media page that without cellphone internet   working alarm system, village residents have  bang   rail  warn neighbors   attack. The authorities promised  look into improving connectivity   area.

Authorities elsewhere also announced steps  minimize disruptions  opening Wi-Fi spots. They also  reportedly planning  establish  agency  coordinate  shutdowns, according  Izvestia,  Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said   unaware   plan.

Russian  Ukrainian drones  cellphone internet networks  operate,  shutdowns    authorities   counter  attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko,  Russia analyst   Washington-based Institute   Study  War.

But ' also part   Kremlin' long-term effort  rein   internet. Authorities have actively censored online content   last decade, blocking thousands  websites  independent media, opposition groups  human rights organizations.

After Russia' full-scale invasion  Ukraine  2022,  government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook  Instagram,  well  encrypted messenger platform Signal    other messaging apps.

Access  YouTube — wildly popular  Russia —  disrupted last year  what experts called deliberate throttling   authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google   properly maintaining  hardware  Russia.

Along with  shutdowns, these  part   larger campaign “ establish control over  internet, which  something  Kremlin  failed   20 years prior   same level that China ,” said  ISW' Stepanenko.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding  California' high-speed rail project  Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about   state will make good   long-delayed promise  building  bullet train  shuttle riders between San Francisco  Los Angeles.

The U.S. Transportation Department announced   pulling back $4 billion  funding   project, weeks after signaling  would  . Overall,  little less than  quarter   project' funding  come from  federal government. The rest  come from  state, mainly through  voter-approved bond  money from  --trade program.

President Donald Trump  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed  project   “train  nowhere."

“The Railroad  were promised still does  exist,  never will," Trump wrote  Truth Social. "This project  Severely Overpriced, Overregulated,  NEVER DELIVERED.”

The loss marks  latest blow  California   Trump administration, which  blocked  first---nation rule  phase   sale   -powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies  threatened  pull funding over transgender girls being allowed  compete  girls sports.

It also comes  rail project leaders  seeking private investment  help    estimated price   more than $100 billion.

Voters first approved  project  2008    supposed   operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown   timeline pushed back.

State officials   focused  building  119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting  Central Valley cities  Bakersfield  Merced that     operating  2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority  slated  release  report this summer  state lawmakers with  updated funding plan  timeline   project.

Authority officials wrote   letter earlier this month that  Trump administration made   mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing  project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts  bridges  separate  rail line from roadways  safety.

“Canceling these grants without cause ’ just wrong — ’ illegal,” authority CEO Ian Choudri said   statement Wednesday. “These  legally binding agreements,   Authority   every obligation,  confirmed  repeated federal reviews,  recently  February 2025."

The authority  asked potential private investors  express their interest      month.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said  state will keep “ options   table”  fight  revocation  federal funds.

“Trump wants  hand China  future  abandon  Central Valley. We ’  ,"  said   statement.

The state  “ viable plan”  complete even  Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator   transportation department' Federal Railroad Administration,   report released last month. He called  project  “story  broken promises”   waste  taxpayer dollars.

California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said   budget hearing earlier this year that  constituents “overwhelmingly believe” high-speed rail spending “ been irresponsible.”

Newsom plans  extend  state' --trade program,   funding source   project which    expire     2030, through 2045.

The program sets  declining limit   total amount  greenhouse  emissions large emitters  release. Those polluters   allowances from  state needed  pollute,  about 45%  that money goes into what' known   Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according   Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee,  group  experts that reviews  program.

The fund helps   climate  transportation projects, including high-speed rail.

The bullet train project receives 25%   money from  fund, which ends  being  little less   little more than $1 billion annually, depending   year. Newsom  May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion  year   project from  fund,  lawmakers have  agreed  that.

OpenAI should continue   controlled   nonprofit because  artificial intelligence technology   developing  “ consequential”   governed   corporation alone.

That   message from  advisory board convened  OpenAI  give  recommendations about  nonprofit structure — delivered   report released Thursday, along with  sweeping vision  democratizing AI  reforming philanthropy.

“We think ’  important  entrust    sector,  private sector  even  government sector,” said Daniel Zingale,  convener  OpenAI’ nonprofit commission   former adviser  three California governors. “The nonprofit model allows  what  call  common sector,” that facilitates democratic participation.

The recommendations   binding  OpenAI,   advisory commission, which includes  labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers  framework that   used  judge OpenAI   future, whether   they adopt .

In  commission' view, communities that  already feeling  impacts  AI technologies should have input   they  developed, including  data about them  used. But there  currently  avenues  people  influence tech companies  control much   development  AI.

OpenAI,  maker  ChatGPT, started  2015   nonprofit research laboratory   since incorporated  -profit company with  valuation that  grown  $300 billion. The company  tried  change  structure since  nonprofit board ousted  CEO Sam Altman  Nov. 2023. He  reinstated days later  continues  lead OpenAI.

It   into hurdles escaping  nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from  attorney generals  California  Delaware,  have oversight  nonprofits,   lawsuit  Elon Musk,  early donor   founder  OpenAI.

Most recently, OpenAI  said  will turn  -profit company into  public benefit corporation, which must balance  interests  shareholders   mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares  that  corporation,  OpenAI   said  much.

Zingale said Huerta told  commission their challenge   help make sure AI   blessing    curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision  nonprofit with  expansive mandate  help everyone participate   development  trajectory  AI.

“The measure  this nonprofit will   what  builds,   includes,   faithfully  endures  mission  impact," they wrote.

The commission toured California communities  solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired  OpenAI’ mission  create artificial intelligence  benefit humanity  ensure those benefits  felt widely  evenly.

But, Zingale said many people feel they    dark about  ’ happening.

“They know this  profoundly important what’ happening  this ‘Age  Intelligence,’  they want  understand better what  ,  ’ developed, where   important choices being made  ’ making them?”  said.

Zingale said  commission chose early    interact with Altman     order  maintain their independence, though they quote   their report. However, they  speak with  company’ senior engineers,  they said, “entered  space with humility, seriousness,   genuine desire  understand  their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.”

The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources   nonprofit     public interest. For context,  nonprofit reported $23 million  assets  2023,  most recent year that   filing  available.

The commission recommend focusing  closing gaps  economic opportunity, investing  AI literacy  creating  organization that  accessible   governed  everyday people.

“For OpenAI’ nonprofit  fulfill  mandate,  should commit  more than just doing good -  should commit  being known, seen,  shaped   people  claims  serve,” they wrote.

The commission suggested opening  rapid response fund  help reduce economic strains . Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater,   health.

“We' trying  make  point that they need  dedicate some  their resources  human  human activities,”  said.

The commission also recommended setting   requirement that  human lead  nonprofit, which Zingale said   serious recommendation  “ sign   times."

Before  mayor  San Jose, California, arrives   ribbon-cutting ceremony    business,  aides  ChatGPT  help draft some talking points.

“Elected officials   tremendous amount  public speaking,” said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary  taken  from  restaurant  semiconductor startup openings   festival  lowriding  culture.

Other politicians might  skittish admitting  chatbot -wrote their speech  that  helped draft  $5.6 billion budget    fiscal year,  Mahan  trying  lead  example, pushing  growing number   nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley' biggest city  embrace artificial intelligence technology.

Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work  help  city better serve  roughly 1 million residents.

He’ hardly  only public  private sector executive directing  AI--bust strategy, though  some cases, workers have found that  costly technology   hassles  mistakes.

“The idea    things,  really transparent, look  problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies,  then work with vendors  internal teams  problem solve,” Mahan said   interview. “It’ always bumpy with  technologies.”

By next year,  city intends  have 1,000,  about 15%,   workers trained   AI tools   variety  tasks, including pothole complaint response,  routing  using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras  solve crimes.

One  San Jose' early adopters  Andrea Arjona Amador,  leads electric mobility programs   city’ transportation department. She  already used ChatGPT  secure  $12 million grant  electric vehicle chargers.

Arjona Amador    customized “AI agent”  review  correspondence   receiving about various grant proposals  asked   help organize  incoming information, including  dates. Then,    help draft  20-page document.

So , San Jose  spent more than $35,000  purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses --  $400  account --  city workers  .

“The   used  work, before I started using this,  spent    evenings  weekends trying   grants   finish line,”  said. The Trump administration later rescinded  funding,   pitched  similar proposal   regional funder  tied   federal government.

Arjona Amador,  learned Spanish  French before  learned English, also created another customized chatbot  edit  tone  language   professional writings.

With close relationships  some   tech industry' biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI  Mountain View-based Google,  mayors   Bay Area' biggest cities  helping  promote  type  AI adoption that  tech industry  striving , while also promising guidelines  standards  avoid  technology' harms.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced  plan Monday  give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses  social workers, access  Microsoft’ Copilot chatbot, which  based   same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco' plan says  comes with “robust privacy  bias safeguards,  clear guidelines  ensure technology enhances —  replaces — human judgment.”

San Jose  similar guidelines  hasn'  reported  major mishaps with  pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because   technology' propensity  spew false information, known  hallucinations.

ChatGPT' digital fingerprints were found   error-filled document published  May  U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.' "Make America Healthy Again" commission.

In Fresno, California,  school official  forced  resign after saying    trusting   AI chatbot that fabricated information   document.

While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn  chatbots  help, Mahan  open about  ChatGPT-written background memos that  turns  when making speeches.

“Historically, that would have taken hours  phone calls  reading,   just never would have been able   those insights,"  said. "You  knock  these tasks   similar  better level  quality    less time.”

He added, however, that " still need  human being   loop. You ’ just kind  press  couple  buttons  trust  output. You still have   some independent verification. You have  have logic  common sense   questions.”

Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced   pilot product called Operator,  promised   kind  tool that went beyond  chatbot' capabilities. Instead  just analyzing documents  producing passages  text,  could also access  computer system  schedule calendars  perform tasks   person' behalf. Developing  selling such “AI agents"     focus   tech industry.

More than  hour' drive east  Silicon Valley, where  Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director  information technology   city  Stockton,   visions  what  could  with such  agent.

Perhaps  parks  recreation department could   AI agent help residents book  public park  swimming pool   birthday party. Or residents could find   crowded  pool  before packing their swim clothes.

Six months later, however, after completing  proof--concept phase,  city didn'   full license   technology    cost.

The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40%  “agentic AI” projects will  canceled before    2027, “  escalating costs, unclear business value  inadequate risk controls.”

San Jose' mayor remains bullish about  potential  these AI tools  help workers “  bowels  bureaucracy”  rapidly speed  their digital paperwork.

“There’ just  amazing amount  bureaucracy that large organizations have  have,” Mahan said. “Whether ’ finance, accounting, HR  grant writing, those   kinds  roles where  think  employees   20 () 50% more productive -- quickly.”

BANGKOK -- China' state security agency says   cracking down  alleged smuggling  rare earths minerals that  says threaten national security, just weeks after Beijing  Washington agreed  make  easier  American firms  obtain from China those materials, which  critical  manufacturing  computer chip production.

In  report published Friday   state- newspaper Global Times,  Ministry  State Security said foreign “espionage  intelligence agencies” were colluding  steal rare earths-related goods  repackaging  relabeling rare metals  hide their Chinese origin.

In some cases  minerals were falsely declared  -controlled items, mislabeled  such things  “solder paste,” mixed into other materials like ceramic tiles,  hidden  plastic mannequins  bottled water,  said.

It referred only   unnamed “certain country” that  said lacked  capacity  make  refine   rare earths.

Investigations  found Chinese criminals were involved, exploiting shipping  delivery channels  evade controls  exports   materials used  many high-tech applications including electric vehicle batteries,  said.

The crackdown followed  report  Reuters earlier this month detailing  rare earths were being transshipped   U.S.  Thailand  Mexico.

In April, Beijing imposed permitting requirements  seven rare earth elements, under  Chinese  that applies   exports,  just those bound   U.S. market.

With  permitting process taking 45 days,   requirement caused  pause  shipments, threatening  disrupt production  cars, robots, wind turbines  other high-tech products   U.S.  around  world. The U.S., meanwhile, added  restrictions  exports  advanced technologies  China.

Planned Parenthood    partial victory   legal fight with President Donald Trump’ administration over  efforts  defund  organization   legislation

BOSTON -- Planned Parenthood   partial victory Monday   legal fight with President Donald Trump’ administration over efforts  defund  organization   signature  legislation.

A provision  that bill ends Medicaid payments   year  abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid  2023, even  those like Planned Parenthood that also offer things like contraception, pregnancy tests  STD testing.

But U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani  Boston granted  preliminary injunction Monday that,  , blocks  government from cutting Medicaid payments  Planned Parenthood member organizations that either ’ provide abortion care  didn’ meet  threshold   least $800,000  Medicaid reimbursements   given year.

It wasn’ immediately clear  many Planned Parenthood organizations  clinics would continue   Medicaid reimbursements under that decision   many might .

Planned Parenthood said   statement after  injunction that ' thankful  court recognized “ harm” caused   bill. But  said ' disappointed that some   members will lose this funding, “risking chaos, confusion,  harm  patients  could   turned away when seeking lifesaving reproductive health care.”

“The court    ruled  whether  will grant preliminary injunctive relief  other members,”  statement added. "We remain hopeful that  court will grant this relief. There will  nothing short   public health crisis  Planned Parenthood members  allowed   ‘defunded.’”

The lawsuit  filed earlier this month against Health  Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Planned Parenthood Federation  America   member organizations  Massachusetts  Utah.

Planned Parenthood argued that allowing  provision  take effect would have devastating consequences nationwide, including increased rates  undiagnosed  untreated sexually transmitted diseases  cancer.

“With  reason other than plain animus,   will prevent Planned Parenthood Members from providing vital — indeed, lifesaving — care  more than  million patients,” they wrote. “This statute  unconstitutional  will inflict irreparable harm  Planned Parenthood Members  their patients."

Lawyers   government argued  court documents that  bill “stops federal subsidies  Big Abortion.”

“All three democratically elected components   Federal Government collaborated  enact that provision consistent with their electoral mandates from  American people    they want their hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent,”  government wrote   opposition   motion.

The government added that  plaintiffs “ want this Court  reject that judgment  supplant duly enacted legislation with their  policy preferences. ... That request  legally groundless.”

Hours after  lawsuit  filed, Talwani issued  temporary restraining order that prevented  government from enforcing  cuts. That order  been   expire Monday.

WASHINGTON -- Shares  drugmaker Sarepta Therapeutics continued  sink Tuesday after  company said  would comply with  Food  Drug Administration request  pause shipments   gene therapy following several patient deaths.

The decision, announced late Monday, comes just days after  company rebuffed FDA regulators   extremely unusual decision that alarmed investors  analysts.

Sarepta CEO Doug Ingram said  company seeks  “productive  positive” relationship with FDA  that “maintaining that productive working relationship required this temporary suspension.”

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said  would “ temporarily pause  shipments”   gene therapy Elevidys  muscular dystrophy   close  business Tuesday.

It'  latest   series  highly irregular moves that have rocked company shares  weeks  forced     hundreds  staffers.

Elevidys   first gene therapy approved   U.S.  Duchenne’ muscular dystrophy,  fatal muscle-wasting disease that affects boys  young , resulting  early death. The -time treatment  initially approved  boys  4  younger  could still walk. Last year, FDA expanded approval  older patients    longer able  walk.

The therapy  already under FDA scrutiny after  teenage boys died earlier this year from acute liver injury,  known side effect   treatment. Then  company last week disclosed  third death with  different therapy:  51-year- patient   enrolled   company trial  another form  muscular dystrophy.

FDA responded  Friday  asking  company  immediately halt  shipments  Elevidys. Company executives initially refused, noting that  latest death   tied  Elevidys,  best-selling product.

Wall Street analysts said  company made  right decision  cooperate.

Defying  FDA would have “irreparably damaged  company’ relationship with FDA under  current leadership  administration,” TD Cowen analyst Ritu Baral told investors   note Tuesday.

Baral estimated  pause  distribution would last three   months.

The FDA   authority  pull drugs from  market,   process  take months  even years. Instead,  agency usually makes  informal request  companies almost always comply. Even   rare cases when drugmakers haven’ cooperated,  FDA  prevailed after public hearings  appeals.

The U.S.  developing  safeguards   organ transplant system after  government investigation found  Kentucky group continued preparations  donation  some patients  showed signs  life

WASHINGTON -- The U.S.  developing  safeguards   organ transplant system after  government investigation found  Kentucky group continued preparations  organ donation  some patients  showed signs  life, officials told Congress Tuesday.

While  organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked   repair trust   transplant network  potential organ donors  families -- some  whom have opted   donor registries after these cases were publicized.

“We have   this right,” said Rep. Brett Guthrie,  Kentucky Republican  chairs  Energy  Commerce Committee  whose mother died waiting   liver transplant.

“Hopefully people will walk away today knowing  need  address issues  still confident that they  give life,” Guthrie said, adding that  will remain  registered organ donor.

The hearing came after  federal investigation began last fall into allegations that  Kentucky donation group pressured  hospital  2021  proceed with plans  withdraw life support  retrieve organs from   despite signs that  might  waking  from  drug overdose. That surgery never happened after  doctor noticed  moving  moaning while being transported   operating room —    survived.

Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately  save tens  thousands  lives  year. But  federal probe – concluded  March  only made public ahead  Tuesday’ hearing -- cited  “concerning pattern  risk”  dozens  other cases involving  Kentucky group' initial planning  recover someone' organs.

The report said some should have been stopped  reassessed earlier,  mostly involved small  rural hospitals with less experience  caring  potential organ donors.

The Kentucky organ procurement organization,  OPO,  made changes   national transplant network  working  additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday   testimony from hospitals – whose doctors must independently determine  patient  dead before donation groups  allowed  retrieve organs.

Here'  look    nation' transplant system works.

More than 100,000 people    U.S. transplant list  about 13    waiting, according   Organ Procurement  Transplantation Network.

Only about 1%  deaths occur    that allows someone  even  considered  organ donation. Most people declared dead   hospital will quickly  transferred   funeral home  morgue instead.

Several groups  involved  every transplant:  hospital caring  someone dead  dying;  55 OPOs that coordinate recovery  organs  help match them  patients   waiting list;  transplant centers that decide   organ   right   their patients.

Adding   complexity,  government agencies — HRSA,  Health Resources  Services Administration,   Centers  Medicare  Medicaid Services — share regulatory oversight  different parts   donation  transplant process.

Most organ donors  brain-dead – when testing determines someone   brain function after  catastrophic injury. The body  left   ventilator  support  organs until they   retrieved.

But increasingly organs  donated after circulatory death, called DCD – when people  because their heart stops. It usually happens when doctors determine someone   nonsurvivable injury   family withdraws life support.

Hospitals  required  alert their area OPO  every potential donor   declared brain-dead  once  decision  withdraw life support  made. The OPOs   ' participate  that decision  "   even   room  that time,” said Barry Massa  Kentucky' Network  Hope.

During  following days  preparation, hospital employees continue caring   patient – while  donation team talks with  family about  process, gathers hospital records showing  patient  eligible, requests tests  organ quality,  make arrangements with transplant centers   them.

Once  hospital withdraws life support   heart stops beating there’  mandatory wait – five minutes –   sure  ’ restart. When  doctor declares death,  organ retrieval process  begin.

Organs  only considered usable  death occurs relatively quickly, usually   about  hours. Sometimes that takes much longer  thus  organs ’  used –  HRSA’ Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn’ necessarily mean anything  done wrong. Still,  said HRSA  investigating reports  possible mistakes elsewhere.

“This   technically demanding form  care” that requires “good collaboration between  OPO   hospital,”  said.

At issue   doctors  sure when ’ time  withdraw life support from  dying patient —   delicate balance   OPOs interact with hospital staff  preparing  donation once death occurs.

In May, HRSA quietly ordered  U.S. transplant network  oversee improvements   Kentucky OPO   develop  national policies making clear that anyone – family, hospital staff  organ donation staff –  call   pause  donation preparations  time there  concerns about  patient’ eligibility.

Lynch said  government  wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs  give hospital staff “ clear understanding”  when   least temporarily halt  reevaluate  potential donor  their health status changes.

Kentucky' Massa said  group only received HRSA’ reports this week –  that after learning about last fall’ allegations,  made some changes. Massa said every hospital doctor  nurse  gets  checklist  caring  potential donors    pause when concerns  raised —  anyone  anonymously report complaints.

Chronic venous insufficiency,  CVI, happens when veins   legs ' properly carry blood back   heart. That  lead  blood pooling   lower legs. In addition  swelling, usually around  feet  ankles, symptoms  include legs that  achy, heavy feeling  tingly,  varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger  sores known  ulcers.

Risk factors  include blood clots, vein inflammation known  phlebitis  being overweight.

Doctors must rule  serious causes   swelling, such  heart problems, kidney disease  blood clots. Ultrasound exams    veins  help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According   Cleveland Clinic, treatment  include wearing compression stockings, elevating  legs  achieving  healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking,  recommended — because strong  muscles  squeeze veins    that helps them pump blood. Medications  medical procedures  available  more advanced cases.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists  hasn’ wavered   duty  protect  civil rights  America’ children even   dismantles  Education Department. Yet   data shows  agency  resolved  fewer civil rights cases than  past years despite families filing more complaints.

The Education Department’ civil rights branch lost nearly half  staff amid mass layoffs  March, raising questions about  ability  address  deep backlog  complaints from students alleging discrimination based  disability,   race. Pressed   issue  June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied  slowdown.

“Not only   reducing  backlog,    keeping  with  current amount with  reduced staff because   doing  efficiently,” McMahon said   Senate budget hearing.

By several measures, however,  output   Office  Civil Rights appears  have fallen sharply  comparison with previous years. A public database   office’ resolution agreements — cases  which schools  universities voluntarily agreed  address civil rights concerns — suggests  office’ work  slowed.

The database lists just 65 resolutions   this year,  pace  fall  below previous years’ totals. Last year  office logged 380 resolutions  total, following 561  2023. During President Donald Trump’ first term,  office averaged more than 800 resolutions  year, including 1,300 during  first year  office.

Other internal data obtained  The Associated Press show  similar trend. Since Trump took office,  total number  resolved cases  down about 40% from  same time frame last year — including cases that were dismissed, mediated  reached  voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also  been  70% decrease   number  cases resolved through resolution agreements  action taken   school  comply with federal ,  internal data shows.

Meanwhile,  complaints have increased 9%. The total number  cases   climbed beyond 25,000.

An Education Department spokesperson said  Trump administration  fixing  broken system.

“When staff levels were  their peak, OCR’ processes still proved   ineffective,  evidenced   chronic backlog  tens  thousands  cases that left students’ discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,” spokesperson Julie Hartman said.

Parents  advocates  they’ noticed  difference.

Adrienne Hazel filed  complaint  April after  20-year-  Ricky,   autism,  placed   public school program without  certified teacher    given  individual learning plan. Hazel,  Southfield, Michigan,   heard from  federal office after receiving  automatic reply when  filed  complaint.

Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed  separate complaint   . The office notified Ricky’ school, which Hazel says spurred  district  reach  agreement with  within about three months. This time,  said,  feels like ’   .

“There  been zero response  this,”  said. “He’ basically going into  babysitting situation. He’  getting  things that  needs  grow into independence. And ’ just  aging without getting  education.”

Marcie Lipsitt,  special education advocate  Michigan  worked with Hazel, said such stories  common. She helps families file complaints  warns  could take  least  year before  investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked  previous agreements,  said,  parents ’   response from  federal office.

“It’ horrible. I’ watching children suffer like they’ never suffered,”  said. “There   accountability.”

The fate   Education Department itself   question   Trump administration moves ahead with  plan  wind down  agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared     agency  continue mass layoffs  outsource some functions  other agencies. McMahon previously suggested  civil rights work could  managed   Justice Department.

Still, McMahon said  June that  office  making headway after inheriting  backlog  20,000 cases from  Biden administration. She told senators  office  catching    backlog  keeping  with  complaints.

With half  staff, many question  that’ possible. In  June court order pausing  termination  Office  Civil Rights employees,  federal judge  Boston said  branch  “currently incapable  addressing  vast majority”  complaints. More than 200   office’ employees remain  leave while that case  decided.

The Office  Civil Rights  responsible  enforcing civil rights laws across  nation’ schools   often  last resort  parents  students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints ,  those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others  dismissed  move   mediation process.

Of  65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those,  vast majority involve complaints  discrimination based  disability, with smaller numbers based    race. Most    discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes   women’ sports,   Trump’ campaign promises.

"OCR will continue  meet  statutory responsibilities while driving  improve efficiency  resolve  longstanding backlog,“ Hartman said.

Multiple workers   office  spoke  condition  anonymity  fear  retaliation said caseloads have grown    manage. In last year’ budget request,  office said   becoming difficult  keep  when investigative staff averaged 42 cases  person. Some estimates   current caseload beyond 200.

The employees said  means more cases will languish.

Another parent  Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn’ heard from  department since  filed  complaint  May. Her , Brady,   blind       learning disability, wasn’ getting  type  help  school promised, including access  teachers’ notes  reduced coursework. Brady, 14, made  academic progress  eighth grade,  ’  heading  high school without  support  needs,  mother said.

“It’ been  frustrating   even have  update  ,” said Clouse,  Ann Arbor. “He  going    high school  fail. I feel like  child will    high school diploma   stays  Ann Arbor Public Schools.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call  sister —  nurse  Mexico —  advice    manage  asthma  control  husband’ diabetes instead  going   doctor  California.

She didn’ have legal status,   couldn’  health insurance  skipped routine exams, relying instead  home remedies ,  times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted  using only  first name  fear  deportation.

Things changed  Maria  many others  recent years when  handful  Democrat- states opened  their health insurance programs  -income immigrants regardless  their legal status. Maria   husband signed     program began last year.

“It changed immensely, like from Earth   heavens,” Maria said  Spanish  Medi-Cal, California’ Medicaid program. “Having  peace  mind  getting insurance leads   getting sick less.”

At least seven states   District  Columbia have offered coverage  immigrants since mostly 2020. But three  them have done  about-face, ending  limiting coverage  hundreds  thousands  immigrants  aren’   U.S. legally  California, Illinois  Minnesota.

The programs cost  more than officials  projected   time when  states  facing multibillion-dollar deficits     future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care  save  estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants  Minnesota  longer have access   state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California,   will automatically lose coverage,   enrollments  adults will stop  2026  save more than $3 billion over several years.

Cuts   three states were backed  Democratic governors  once championed expanding health coverage  immigrants.

The Trump administration this week shared  home addresses, ethnicities  personal data   Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration  Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois  Minnesota, have sued.

Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially  fear  being arrested  deported,  having  chilling effect  people seeking care. And states  have  spend more money down  road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care    needing    safety- hospitals.

“I feel like they continue  squeeze  more  more   point where ’ burst,” Maria said, referencing   uncertainties  people     U.S. without legal permission.

People   free  community health clinics  California  Minnesota said patients    state Medicaid programs received knee replacements  heart procedures,  were diagnosed  serious conditions like late-stage cancer.

CommunityHealth     nation’ largest free clinics, serving many uninsured  underinsured immigrants   Chicago area  have  other options  treatment. That includes  people  lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended  Health Benefits  Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.

One  CommunityHealth’ community outreach workers  care coordinator said Eastern European patients  works with started coming  with questions about what  change meant  them. She said many   patients also ’ speak English  ’ have transportation    clinics that  treat them. The worker spoke   AP  condition  anonymity  protect patients’ privacy.

Health Finders Collective  Minnesota' rural Rice  Steele counties south  Minneapolis serves -income  underinsured patients, including large populations  Latino immigrants  Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they’ seeing patients rushing  squeeze  appointments  procedures before 19,000 people  18  older  kicked   insurance      year.

Free  community health clinics   three states  they will keep serving patients regardless  insurance coverage —  that might  harder after  U.S. Department  Health  Human Services decided this month  restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.

CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said  always worried about  stability   program because   fully state funded, “ truthfully,  thought that   much, much further away.”

“People  going  . Some people  going   untreated,” Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer  CommuniCARE+OLE clinics  California, said   state' Medicaid changes. “It’ hard    humanity   decision-making that’ happening right .”

A spokesperson   Minnesota Department  Health said ending  state’ program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending   short term,   acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care  hospitals.

Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth,  Republican, said  state' program   sustainable.

“It wasn’ about trying   -compassionate   caring about people,"  said. "When  looked   state budget,  dollars were  there  support what  passed  what  being spent.”

Demuth also noted that children will still have coverage,  adults lacking permanent legal status   private health insurance.

Health care providers also  worried that preventable conditions will  unmanaged,  people will avoid care until they    emergency rooms – where care will  available under federal .

One  those safety- public hospitals, Cook County Health  Chicago, treated about 8,000 patients from Illinois’ program last year. Dr. Erik Mikaitis,  health system’ CEO, said doing  brought  $111 million  revenue.

But  anticipated other providers  billed through  program could close,  said, adding: “Things  become unstable very quickly.”

State lawmakers said California’ Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues —  $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Democratic state leaders last month agreed  stop  enrollment starting  2026   -income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining   program will have    $30 monthly   2027.

States  also bracing  impact from federal policies. Cuts  Medicaid  other programs   recently signed massive   spending bill include  10%    federal share  Medicaid expansion costs  states that offer health benefits  immigrants starting October 2027.

California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after  first full year  restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with  rollbacks, California provides  most expansive health care coverage  poor adults.

Every  bill requires  shift  Maria' monthly calculations  make ends meet. She believes many people ’  able  afford  $30--month premiums  will instead  back  self-medication  skip treatment altogether.

“It   total triumph,”  said  Medi-Cal expansion. “But  that   this  coming  , ’ going backwards   worse place.”

Fear  tension about immigration raids  changing patient behavior, . Providers told  AP that,  immigration raids ramped , their patients were requesting more virtual appointments,  showing   routine doctor’ visits   picking  prescriptions  their chronic conditions.

Maria   option  keep  coverage. But   weighing  health   family against risking what they’ built   U.S.

“It’ going   very difficult,” Maria said   decision  remain   program. “If  comes   point where  husband gets sick   life   risk, well then, obviously,  have  choose  life.”

The removal  21 children from  custody   Los Angeles-area couple    spotlight   practice  using surrogates  build  family. Surrogacy   federal regulation, leaving    states    rules  they choose  allow .

The kids — 15   couple' mansion   more living elsewhere — were taken   LA County child welfare agency  May after  parents were accused  failing  intervene   abuse   baby   nanny, police  Arcadia said.

The children range   from 2 months  13 years, with most between 1  3, police said. The FBI ’ comment  agents  investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38,  Guojun Xuan, 65, have  responded  emails seeking comment.

Police believe Zhang gave birth       children while  rest were born  surrogate. Some women  were paid surrogates   couple   they were unaware that  couple  accumulating  supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.

“What were they going   with these children?” said Deborah Wald,  lawyer  San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy .

Surrogacy   agreement between parties  have  woman become pregnant, typically through  embryo transfer,  deliver  baby. The intended parent  parents might struggle with infertility. They also could  same- couples.

There’  limit   many children someone  have through surrogates   other method, said Wald,    involved   Arcadia case.

She acknowledged that California  considered  “surrogacy-friendly state" because   clear laws around  process.

Both sides  required  have lawyers,  there must   written, notarized contract before  embryo transfer, Wald said.

“The legitimate surrogacy community  California  very distressed when things like this happen,” Wald said  surrogates feeling deceived. ”We’ worked very hard  legal  ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.”

There  businesses that   matchmakers, connecting surrogates  people  want  have children. State business records show  company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC  been registered   Arcadia address  Zhang  Xuan.

It’  clear  Zhang  Xuan    business solely  find surrogates  themselves. State records show  company terminated  business license  June.

Wald said there   special licensing requirements  California  businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.

Wald said there should have been plenty  checks  balances   process, noting  role  fertility clinics  handling embryos.

“The first place typically   matching program that matches  surrogate with  intended parent. But  this situation  intended parents were  matching program,” Wald said. “I   familiar with  other prior case where that  true.”

Arcadia police said   children  were    couple' home were found with family friends. The couple' house  “    school environment,” Lt. Kollin Cieadlo said.

Zhang  Xuan were accused  neglect  arrested  May. Charges were  formally pursued  that time  order   abuse investigation  continue,  detectives  believe there were other instances  abuse, Cieadlo said.

A 2-month- infant with  traumatic head injury, allegedly   hands   nanny, remains   hospital  stable condition,  said.

California  requires child welfare agencies  prioritize placing children  cannot safely  with their parents  homes with extended family,  requires siblings   kept together unless  would endanger  child   , said Leslie Heimov,  executive director   Children’ Law Center  California.

The Children’ Law Center  worked with some families with 10  12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children  more  “unusual,"  added.

It’ more complicated  find foster homes  larger families that  accommodate   children’ needs, especially  infants, Heimov said.

In addition  expenses  limited space, ' hard  give infants  proper stimulation  care they need  they    home with many other children,  said.

In cases involving many children,  state will sometimes  creative  make sure that siblings  maintain relationships with each other, like placing them   same neighborhood,  placing them  different  related households, Heimov said.

A case involving over 20 children conceived through surrogacy would “present some legal questions,” said Heimov. “But  would  change  advocacy —  want every child  represent     loving, safe home."

Measles cases   U.S.   their highest  three decades

The US  having  worst year  measles  more than three decades

The U.S.  having  worst year  measles spread  more than three decades, with  total  1,288 cases nationally  another  months    2025.

The U.S. Centers  Disease Control  Prevention said Wednesday that  national case count surpassed 2019, when there were 1,274 cases   year   country almost lost  status  having eliminated  vaccine-preventable illness. That could happen this year   virus  nonstop spread  12 months.

This year' outbreaks, some  them interconnected, started five months   undervaccinated communities  West Texas. Three people have died —  children  Texas   adult  New Mexico —  dozens  people have been hospitalized. Public health experts maintain  true case count   higher than state health departments have confirmed.

North America  three other major measles outbreaks, with 2,966 cases  Chihuahua state, Mexico, 2,223 cases  Ontario, Canada  1,230  Alberta, Canada. Twelve other states have current confirmed outbreaks  three  more people — Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma  Utah —  four other states  their outbreaks .

The measles, mumps  rubella vaccine  97% effective  preventing measles after  doses.

The World Health Organization said  2000 that measles  been eliminated from  U.S.

The CDC identified 22 outbreaks  2019,  largest being  separate clusters  New York — 412  New York state  702  New York City. These were linked because  measles  spreading through close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities,  CDC said.

It'  similar situation  North America this year, where  Canada, Mexico  Texas outbreaks stem from large Mennonite communities   regions. Mennonite churches   formally discourage vaccination, though more conservative Mennonite communities historically have  vaccination rates   distrust  government.

A recent study found childhood vaccination rates against measles fell after  COVID-19 pandemic  nearly 80%   more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data, including  states that  battling outbreaks this year.

“What ’ seeing with measles   little    ‘canary   coal mine,'" said Lauren Gardner, leader  Johns Hopkins University' independent measles  COVID tracking databases. "It’ indicative   problem that  know exists with vaccination attitudes  this county  just, I think, likely   worse.”

WASHINGTON -- Human-caused climate change  responsible  killing about 1,500 people  last week' European heat wave,  first---kind rapid study found.

Those 1,500 people “have only died because  climate change,  they would  have died   would  have been   burning  , coal     last century,” said study -author Friederike Otto,  climate scientist  Imperial College  London.

Scientists  Imperial   London School  Hygiene  Tropical Medicine used peer-reviewed techniques  calculate that about 2,300 people  12 cities likely died from  heat  last week' bout  high temperatures, with nearly -thirds  them dying because   extra degrees that climate change added   natural summer warmth.

Past rapid attribution studies have  gone beyond evaluating climate change' role  meteorological effects such  extra heat, flooding  drought. This study goes  step further  directly connecting coal,   natural    people dying.

“Heat waves  silent killers  their health impact  very hard  measure,″ said -author Gary Konstantinoudis,  biostatistician  Imperial College. ”People   understand  actual mortality toll  heat waves  this  because (doctors, hospitals  governments)   report heat   underlying cause  death”  instead attribute   heart  lung  other organ problems.

Of  1,500 deaths attributed  climate change,  study found more than 1,100 were people 75  older.

“It’ summer,  ’ sometimes ," study lead author Ben Clarke  Imperial College said   Tuesday news conference. ”The influence  climate change  pushed    several degrees  what that does   brings certain groups  people more into dangerous territory  that’ what’ important. That’ what  really want  highlight here. For some people ’ still warm fine weather     huge sector   population ' more dangerous."

Researchers looked  June 23  July 2  London; Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Zagreb, Croatia; Athens, Greece; Barcelona, Spain; Madrid; Lisbon, Portugal; Rome; Milan  Sassari, Italy. They found that except  Lisbon,  extra warmth from greenhouse gases added 2  4 degrees Celsius (3.6  7.2 degrees Fahrenheit)  what would have been  more natural heat wave. London   most  nearly 4 degrees (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate change only added about  degree  Lisbon' peak temperature,  study calculated, mostly because   Atlantic Ocean' moderating effect, Otto said.

That extra climate-change-caused heat added  most extra deaths  Milan, Barcelona  Paris   least  Sassari, Frankfort  Lisbon,  study found. The 1,500 figure   middle   range  overall climate-related death estimates that  from about 1,250  around 1,700.

Wednesday' study    peer-reviewed. It   extension  work done   international team  scientists   rapid attribution studies  search  global warming’ fingerprints   growing number  extreme weather events worldwide,  combine that with long-established epidemiological research that examines death trends that differ from what' considered normal.

Researchers compared what  thermometers read last week  what computer simulations  would have happened   world without planet-warming greenhouse gases from fossil fuel . Health researchers then compared estimates — there   solid figures  —  heat deaths  what just happened  what heat deaths would  expected  each city without those extra degrees  warmth.

There  long-established formulas that calculate excess deaths differing from normal based  location, demographics, temperatures  other factors  those  used, Otto  Konstantinoudis said. And health researchers take into account many variables like smoking  chronic diseases,  ' comparing similar people except  temperature  they know that' what'  blame, Konstantinoudis said.

Studies  2021 generally linked excess heat deaths  human-caused climate change  carbon emissions,   specific events like last week'  spell. A 2023 study  Nature Medicine estimated that since 2015,  every degree Celsius  temperature rises  Europe, there'  extra 18,547 summer heat deaths.

Studies like Wednesday'  “ending  guessing game   health harms from continued burning  fossil fuels,” said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director   Center  Health, Energy  Environmental Research   University  Wisconsin. He   part   research  said  “combined  most --date climate  health methods  found that every fraction   degree  warming matters regarding extreme heat waves.”

Dr. Courtney Howard,  Canadian emergency room physician  chair   Global Climate  Health Alliance, said, “Studies like this help   that reducing fossil fuel   health care.”

Will RFK Jr.' push  psychedelic therapy help  hamper  emerging field?

WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents  psychedelic drugs have come  Washington with  provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD  ecstasy should  approved  Americans grappling with depression, trauma  other hard--treat conditions.

A presidential administration finally seems  agree.

“This line  therapeutics  tremendous advantage  given   clinical setting    working very hard  make sure that happens within 12 months,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members  Congress.

His suggested timeline  green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even  most bullish supporters   drugs. And  comes  psychedelics  making inroads  deep  states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary  -governor Rick Perry  thrown  full support behind  effort.

The administration' embrace  psychedelics  sparked both excitement  well  concern from those   field,  worry  drugs might  discredited  they appear   rushed onto  market    closely linked with Kennedy,   known  controversial views  vaccines, antidepressants  fluoride.

“I’ quite optimistic,” says Rick Doblin, whose organization  pursed  medical   MDMA ( ecstasy) since  1980s. “But I’ also worried that  message  public might   ‘Well, RFK likes psychedelics   ’ approved.’”

Under President Joe Biden,  FDA rejected MDMA   treatment  post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data  questionable research. Regulators called    study, likely taking several years. It   major setback  Doblin  other advocates hoping    first U.S. approval   psychedelic  medical .

But  agency appears ready  reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary,  reports  Kennedy,  called  evaluation  MDMA  other psychedelics “  priority,” announcing  slate  initiatives that could  used  accelerate their approval.

One  program promises  expedite drugs that serve “ health interests  Americans,”  slashing their review time from  months  more   little   month. Makary  also suggested greater flexibility  requirements  certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients   placebo group.

That approach, considered essential  high-quality research,  long been  stumbling point  psychedelic studies,  which patients  almost always correctly guess whether they’ received  drug   dummy pill.

The U.S. Department  Health  Human Services  FDA also recently hired several  staffers with ties   psychedelic movement.

“These   very promising signs that  administration  aware   potential  psychedelics   trying  make overtures that they’ ready  approve them,” said Greg Ferenstein,  fellow   libertarian Reason Foundation,  also consults  psychedelic companies. “We didn’ hear anything about that   Biden administration”

A spokesperson  HHS   respond   request  comment.

As  presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed     several close friends benefited from using psychedelics  deal with grief  other issues.

A number  veterans lobbying  psychedelic access have already  with Trump' Secretary  Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.

“What ’ seeing    positive,” Collins told House lawmakers  May.

But some experts worry  hope  hype surrounding psychedelics  gotten ahead   science.

Philip Corlett,  psychiatric researcher  Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could  back  field  jeopardize patients.

"If RFK    administration  serious about this work, there  things they could   shepherd  into reality  meeting  benchmarks  medical science," Corlett said. “I just ’ think that’ going  happen.”

As officials  Washington weigh  future  psychedelics, some states  moving ahead with their  projects  hopes  nudging  federal government. Oregon  Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.

And last month, Texas approved $50 million  study ibogaine,  potent psychedelic made from  shrub that' native  West Africa,   treatment  opioid addiction, PTSD  other conditions. The research grant —  largest   kind   government — passed with support from  state' former GOP governor, Perry,  combat veterans, some  have traveled  clinics  Mexico that offer ibogaine.

Ibogaine    U.S. government’ ultra-restrictive list  illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates  Texas  hoping  build  national movement  ease restrictions  researching  .

“Governmental systems move slowly  inefficiently,” said Bryan Hubbard  Americans  Ibogaine,  group formed with Perry. “Sometimes  find yourself constrained  terms   progress   make from within.”

Ibogaine  unique among psychedelics  both  purported benefits  risks. Small studies  anecdotal reports suggest  drug   able  dramatically ease addiction  trauma. It  sold  medical   France  several decades starting   1930s,   drug  also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which   fatal  left untreated.

Some veterans  have taken  drug   risks   managed  ibogaine’ healing properties   beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling  other standard treatments.

Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia  mood swings after 13 years   Navy Seal. In 2017,   urging   wife Amber,  agreed   ibogaine   last resort. He described  first ibogaine session  “ complete purge  everything.”

“But afterward I felt  weight just completely   shoulders,”  said. “No more anxiety,  more depression, life made sense    sudden.”

A nonprofit founded   Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions,  VETS,  helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad  receive ibogaine  other psychedelics.

But federal scientists have looked   drug before — three decades , when  National Institute  Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies  using    addiction treatment. The research  discontinued after  identified “cardiovascular toxicity."

“It would  dead   water,”  terms  winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.

But Volkow said  agency remains interested  psychedelics, including ibogaine,   funding  American drugmaker that' working  develop  safer, synthetic version   drug.

“I  very intrigued  their pharmacological properties   they  influencing  brain,” Volkow said. “But  also have   very mindful   fall into  hype    objective  rigorous  evaluating them.”

WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals  pioneering  ways  expand lifesaving heart transplants  adults  babies — advances that could help recover would- heart donations that  often  unused.

The  research aims  overcome barriers  using organs from someone  dies when their heart stops. Called DCD,  donation after circulatory death,  involves  controversial recovery technique     expensive machines.

Surgeons  Duke  Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they’ separately devised simpler approaches  retrieve those hearts. In  New England Journal  Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts   3-month- infant  Duke  three   Vanderbilt.

“These DCD hearts work just  well  hearts from brain-dead donors,” said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.

Most transplanted hearts come from donors   brain dead. In those situations,  body  left   ventilator that keeps  heart beating until  organs  removed.

Circulatory death occurs when someone   nonsurvivable brain injury  because  brain function hasn’ ceased,  family decides  withdraw life support   heart stops. That means organs  spend  while without oxygen before being recovered,  time  usually doable  kidneys  other organs  that  raise questions about  quality  hearts.

To counter damage  determine whether DCD organs  usable, surgeons  pump blood  oxygen   deceased donor’ abdominal  chest organs — after clamping  access   brain. But ’ ethically controversial  artificially restore circulation even temporarily  some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion,  NRP.

Another option   “reanimate” DCD organs   machine that pumps blood  nutrients      transplant hospital. The machines  expensive  complex,  Duke’ Dr. Joseph Turek said  devices ’  used  young children’ small hearts —   group with  most dire need.

Turek’ team found  middle ground: Remove  heart  attach some tubes  oxygen  blood  briefly assess  ability  function —    machine    sterile table   operating room.

They practiced with piglets. Then came  real test. At another hospital, life support  about   withdrawn from  1-month- whose family wanted  donate —   would   good match   3-month- Duke patient  desperate need    heart. The other hospital didn’ allow  controversial NRP recovery technique   Turek’ team test  experimental alternative.

It took just five minutes  tell “ coronary arteries  filling well, ’ pink, ’ beating,” Turek said. The team promptly   little heart    raced  back  Duke.

Vanderbilt’ system  even simpler: Infuse  heart with  nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing  from  donor’ body, similar   hearts from brain-dead donors  handled.

That “replenishes  nutrients that  depleted during  dying process  helps protect   transport,” Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt  performed about 25 such transplants  . “Our view   ’ necessarily need  reanimate  heart.”

There'  huge need  more transplantable hearts. Hundreds  thousands  adults suffer from advanced heart failure,  many  never even offered  transplant because   organ shortage.

Every year about 700 children   U.S.  added   transplant list    heart  about 20%  waiting. Turek said infants   particular risk.

Last year, people whose lives ended  circulatory death made  43%   nation’ deceased donors —  just 793   4,572 heart transplants.

That'  many specialists  finding ways   more  those hearts  crucial. The  studies  small  early-stage  promising, said Brendan Parent  NYU Langone Health,  directs transplant ethics  policy research.

“Innovation  find ways  recover organs successfully after circulatory death  essential  reducing  organ shortage,”  said.

If alternatives  , “I absolutely think that cardiac programs will  thrilled, especially  hospitals that have rejected NRP.”

BOBO-DIOULASSO, Burkina Faso -- Isaka Diallo  playing with friends when  stone struck  left . For  weeks,  parents searched hospitals  western Burkina Faso    doctor. The village clinic only prescribed painkillers. Other health workers   know what  .

When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yaméogo, Burkina Faso’ only pediatric ophthalmologist,  injury  become  difficult  treat.

“The trauma  become severe,” Yaméogo said  Diallo’ condition   attended   recently   Sanou Sourou University Hospital   city  Bobo-Dioulasso. “Cases like (Diallo’) must  treated within  first  hours,  I’ seeing   weeks later,  ’ already  late.”

It   common problem   country  about 23 million people, which  just 70 ophthalmologists.

Yaméogo ,  started  practice late last year, said  work  daunting  often requires   visit —   cost — families  cannot afford care  cannot make their    hospital where  works.

While there  limited data available   defects  children  Burkina Faso   Africa  large,  estimated 450 million children globally have  sight problem that needs treatment, according   International Agency   Prevention  Blindness.

Late intervention  significantly alter  child’ future,  organization said, with many such cases  less developed countries.

In Burkina Faso,  estimated 70%   population lives  rural areas. And  ophthalmologists  concentrated   capital, Ouagadougou,  other main cities, making them unreachable  many.

While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed  Burkina Faso’ western Hauts-Bassins region  2024, only 52  those were carried    more rural areas, according   Ministry  Health. Most procedures were done   area  Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso’ second city.

Not many people  aware  Yaméogo’ work. Even when they , traveling  reach  often requires days  planning  financial saving.

In  further challenge  accessing care, Diallo’ family  among  2 million people displaced  violence  extremist groups seize parts   country.

To visit Yaméogo’ hospital from  village where they  sheltering, they   travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles)   motorcycle  Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13)  transport,  high price   small-scale farming family.

At least 70%   trauma cases  children treated   hospital come from rural areas where  risk  exposure — from conflict  from play —  higher, Yaméogo said.

Examining  treating  child   delicate practice that requires    time, something many families ’ afford. Many must return home  earn money   treatment.

As  treated Diallo, Yaméogo noticed that   associated  drawing   apple with  pepper, making  wonder: Is  that  ’  ,  that  doesn’ know what  apple ? The fruit doesn' grow   region where  lives.

“There’  fixed time  examining children,”  said. “You need    patience.”

Yameogo’ work    "very positive impact  training future pediatricians    quality  ophthalmology services,” said Jean Diallo, president   Burkinabè Society  Ophthalmology.

“A child’     same  that   adult, which    need specialists  treat problems early   child  develop properly,” Diallo said.

He cited retinoblastoma,  retinal cancer mostly affecting young children,  congenital cataracts,  diseases that   cured  diagnosed early. Pediatricians ’ necessarily detect them.

During another consultation, Yaméogo told  family  5-year- Fatao Traoré that  would need cornea surgery   result   injury sustained while playing with  stick.

“Sometimes I feel  pinch   heart,” Yaméogo said   examined   after they arrived from their farm   outskirts  Bobo-Dioulasso. “His iris  detached from  cornea,   needs   hospitalized.”

The father, looking overwhelmed, sighed, unsure  where  money   child' surgery would come. On paper, Burkina Faso' government covers  cost  medications  care  children under 5,  often  drugs  available  hospitals, meaning families must  them elsewhere.

A surgery like    Traoré  cost 100,000 CFA ($179), several months' income   family.

Dozens   cream makers pledged  Monday  remove artificial dyes from their products  2028

Ice cream makers representing about 90%   U.S. supply   frozen treat have pledged  remove artificial dyes from their products  less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.

The move   latest voluntary effort  food manufacturers  heed calls from  Trump administration  remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz  General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, .

“This   Renaissance moment  health  America," U.S. Food  Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said   news conference.

About 40 makers   cream  frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products  2028, according  Michael Dykes, president   International Dairy Foods Association. The colors  Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5  Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn' identify  firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined  gathering.

The national focus  artificial food dyes  “ good step  take,"  officials should  ignore larger known contributors  chronic disease, including  added sugars  saturated  commonly found   cream, said Deanna Hoelscher,  University  Texas nutrition expert.

“Just taking   changing  food  source   necessarily going  make   healthy option,”  said. “It still   food that should  consumed  moderation.”

However, Makary also hinted that  federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated   heart disease, ending what  called “ 70-year demonization  natural saturated .”

The average American eats about 4 gallons   cream  year,  IDFA said.

Health advocates have long called   removal  artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they  cause some neurobehavioral problems, such  hyperactivity  attention problems,  some children. The Food  Drug Administration  maintained that approved dyes  safe  that “most children have  adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  criticized  dyes  pressured manufacturers  remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should  dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts  other sources, federal officials said.

The FDA  approved  natural color additives  recent months, including   blue color made from  fruit   gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue  approved    sports drinks, candies  certain other products,  agency said.

Makary also sent  letter  food manufacturers  Monday that “encourages” them  speed  removal    known  Red 3, which  banned  January. Food makers have until 2027  remove  , which  found  cause cancer  laboratory rats,   humans.

Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes,  relying  voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements ' guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan,  scientist with  Center  Science   Public Interest,  consumer advocacy group.

“Talk  cheap,” Galligan said. “It' easy  companies  make promises  look like they' being compliant  generate goodwill among consumers   Trump administration,   remains   seen  they will actually follow through.”

LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born  Britain with  help   experimental technique that uses DNA from three people  help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases  their children, researchers reported Wednesday.

Most DNA  found   nucleus   cells,  ' that genetic material — some inherited from , some from  — that makes    . But there' also some DNA outside   cell' nucleus,  structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there  cause  range  diseases  children that  lead  muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure  death.

Testing during   vitro fertilization process  usually identify whether these mutations  present. But  rare cases, '  clear.

Researchers have been developing  technique that tries  avoid  problem  using  healthy mitochondria from  donor . They reported  2023 that  first babies  been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from  mother'   embryo, which  then transferred into  donor   embryo that  healthy mitochondria   rest    DNA removed.

The latest research “marks  important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams,  directs  Columbia University Fertility Center    involved   work. “Expanding  range  reproductive options … will empower more couples  pursue safe  healthy pregnancies.”

Using this method means  embryo  DNA from three people — from  mother' ,  father' sperm   donor' mitochondria —   required  2016 U.K.  change  approve . It  also allowed  Australia    many other countries, including  U.S.

Experts  Britain’ Newcastle University  Monash University  Australia reported   New England Journal  Medicine Wednesday that they performed   technique  fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted  eight babies that appear   free  mitochondrial diseases. One woman  still pregnant.

One   eight babies born  slightly higher than expected levels  abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge,  stem cell  developmental genetics scientist   Francis Crick Institute    involved   research. He said   still  considered  high enough level  cause disease,  should  monitored   baby develops.

Dr. Andy Greenfield,  reproductive health expert   University  Oxford, called  work “ triumph  scientific innovation,”  said  method  exchanging mitochondria would only  used   small number  women  whom other ways  avoiding passing  genetic diseases, like testing embryos   early stage,   effective.

Lovell-Badge said  amount  DNA from  donor  insignificant, noting that  resulting child would have  traits from  woman  donated  healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from  donated  makes  less than 1%   baby born after this technique.

“If    bone marrow transplant from  donor …  will have much more DNA from another person,”  said.

In  U.K., every couple seeking  baby born through donated mitochondria must  approved   country’ fertility regulator. As  this month, 35 patients have been authorized  undergo  technique.

Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that ' impossible  know  impact these sorts  novel techniques might have  future generations.

“Currently, pronuclear transfer   permitted  clinical    U.S., largely   regulatory restrictions  techniques that result  heritable changes   embryo," Williams,  Columbia, said   email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain  will depend  evolving scientific, ethical,  policy discussions."

For about  decade, Congress  included provisions  annual funding bills banning  Food  Drug Administration from accepting applications  clinical research involving techniques, “ which  human embryo  intentionally created  modified  include  heritable genetic modification.”

But  countries where  technique  allowed, advocates   could provide  promising alternative  some families.

Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died   mitochondrial disease  2006,  works with other families affected  them. She said   devastating   told there   treatment   eight-month- baby  that death  inevitable.

She said  diagnosis “turned  world upside down,   nobody could tell  very much about , what       going  affect Lily.” Curtis later founded  Lily Foundation   daughter’ name  raise awareness  support research into  disease, including  latest work done  Newcastle University.

“It’ super exciting  families that ’ have much hope  their lives,” Curtis said.

APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina’ first standalone children’ hospital will  built   bedroom community near  state capital,  project’ health systems announced Thursday, creating  campus estimated  bring 8,000 jobs   area.

UNC Health  Duke Health announced  January  agreement  jointly build  proposed 500- pediatric hospital  linked facilities   state’ Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham  Chapel Hill.

At that time,  specific location wasn' finalized. But leaders   health systems said Thursday that  “North Carolina Children'” project will  constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest  downtown Raleigh   Wake County town  Apex. Apex   population  77,000, which  already surging  population thanks   region' strong technology economy.

More than 15 potential sites  several counties were considered, Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese said   Apex news conference.

The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus, located near  regional transportation interchange, will also include  children’ outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds   research  education center operated  Duke University  University  North Carolina medical schools.

The campus  poised   integrated into  long-discussed mixed- development location called Veridea that will include thousands   homes, retail, dining, office  research space,  well    Wake Technical Community College campus.

“This campus will create  brighter, healthier future  generations  children  adolescents across North Carolina   Southeast,  ’ thrilled  have Apex   home  partner," UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said   news release.

A groundbreaking   hospital campus   expected  2027, with construction anticipated  take  years. North Carolina Children’ Health also issued  Thursday  request  information from potential design  construction contractors   project.

There  children’ hospitals already  North Carolina, including those operated   University  North Carolina  Duke University health systems that  attached  their main campuses   Triangle.

The Apex location “will ensure that  Triangle remains     destination   best pediatric scientists, teachers  clinicians — convenient  both medical school campuses,” said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean   Duke University medical school   Duke Health executive.

The  children' hospital agreed  acquire  portion   Veridea land, which  owned   business partnership between  North Carolina state retirement system   land developers, according   State Treasurer' Office, which administers  system.

State Treasurer Brad Briner said   news conference that  land sale     everyone involved, including government retirees   pension system, "making  modest profit  unlocking more value   land that  adjacent.”

“Above , '     11 million North Carolinians  deserve world-class pediatric care right here  home,”  added.

The health systems have said  hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion  $3 billion, with  massive private fundraising effort ahead.

The project  already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated  House  Senate Republicans that ultimately would head  Democratic Gov. Josh Stein' desk, also could contain more project funds.

Stein said   interview Thursday that beyond  economic opportunity  project will spark, “I’ really excited about what  children’ hospital means  children  North Carolina   sick   need   best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions  live long, healthy lives.”

Doctor wanted: Small town offers  perks  attract  physician

MedPage Today story.

HAVANA, Fla. -- For  rural community, this town  1,750 people  been more fortunate than most. A family doctor  practiced here   last 30 years.

But that ended  December when Mark Newberry, MD, retired. To attract   doctor, Havana leaders took  want   local newspapers, posted notices  social media,  sweetened   with  rent-free medical office equipped with  -,  ultrasound machine,   bone density scanner --  owned   town.

Local leaders hope  recruitment campaign will help attract candidates amid  nationwide shortage  doctors.

"This  important   community," said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana' town manager, "  same  that parks  important  good future planning  important."

According   Florida Department  Health report, doctor shortages affect   part  nearly every county,  less populous counties, such  Gadsden, where Havana  located, have  fewest physicians  10,000 residents.

Florida' doctor shortage  expected  grow   next decade, with  study projecting  statewide need  18,000 physicians -- including 6,000 primary care doctors --  2035.

"This   huge, huge issue," said Matthew Smeltzer,  managing partner  Capstone Recruiting Advisors,  company that helps hospitals, physician practices,  other employers find  hire doctors. "It probably hits small towns  hardest, just because most people would prefer  live   midsize  large community."

In this challenging environment, Havana leaders  hoping that want   rent-free perks will make their small town stand   persuade  doctor  practice here.

Wilkerson describes  community, just south   Georgia border,   ideal place  raise  family. Its country roads  lined with farms, pastures,  churches. Main Street downtown features antique stores, gift shops,  general store,  restaurants.

"Everything  would imagine  Hallmark movie    kind  where  live," Wilkerson said. "It' people  still care  look   each other,  neighbors  actually friends."

Offering generous incentives   town leaders  Newberry  practice  Havana  1993. The town gave Newberry  initial deal similar    ' offering ,  later began providing  about $15,000  year  financial support.

Newberry,  served about 2,000 patients, declined   interviewed. "I' just retiring!"  said   email, adding that " town  chosen unconventional ways"  recruiting  doctor.

By subsidizing office space     medical equipment  attract  doctor, Havana  looking    needs   residents, Wilkerson said.

Without  town doctor, some  Newberry' former patients  have  travel  Tallahassee, about  30-minute drive southeast  Havana. Others  seeing doctors  Quincy, about  20-minute drive west.

"Our hope  that they' come back when  find    doctor," Havana Mayor Eddie Bass said.

Susan Freiden,  former town manager  retired  2006, said having  local doctor  also important  meet  needs   town' -income residents, many  whom  older adults. "Not everybody    Tallahassee    doctor,"  said. "Not everybody  transportation."

But  remains   seen whether rent-free office space  equipment  enough  attract  doctor  Havana. The town' recruitment campaign  drawn    interest from nurse practitioners,   primary care physicians have applied   position.

Town leaders  they' holding  hope  finding  family physician,   practice  prescribe medications independently.

"We would really,  know, prefer  have  true doctor that  handle    ," Bass said.

Smeltzer,  physician headhunter, said primary care physicians   especially  supply. And though   experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee,  Texas  among  places doctors want  live  work,  often takes something extra  persuade them  work   small town,  said.

"If someone wants  practice   small town, they' more likely    where they have ties, whether ' themselves  their spouse  significant other,"  said.

The challenge   community  Havana' size, Smeltzer said,  that "there  literally  nobody from that town that went   school. Or,  there , maybe ' . But were they  primary care physician?"

Still, there   silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians  placing  high value  work-life balance  meaningful relationships with their patients -- qualities that  give  edge   small-town, independent practice.

"We hear quality  life  work-life balance  more   last 3  5 years than  ever heard before,"  said, " that' almost  lockstep with compensation  terms  what they' focusing ."

Freiden,  former Havana town manager, said those   same values Newberry  when  started  practice here. She even became    patients.

"He  just perfect,"  said, "because  wasn'  about  money,    imagine that. He  kind   different kind  physician."

Fortunately  Havana,  town recently received interest from  family medicine doctor  grew  here, went  medical school,  expects  finish  3-year residency  Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare  June.

Camron Browning, MD,  2003 graduate  Northside Havana High School, told  seven-member Town Council   December interview that   focusing  family medicine  that, during  residency,   seen thousands  patients, delivered babies,  gained experience   hospitalist.

"My goal,"  said, "   able  come home  serve  hometown."

Smeltzer said Havana' incentives could  attractive   doctors, such  Browning,  would face daunting startup costs  establish  independent practice.

After  December interview,  Council voted unanimously  begin contract negotiations with Browning,  said  would plan   ready   patients  soon  possible after completing  residency.

"I' here  stay," Browning told  Council. "This  always  dream."

RFK Jr. Wrong  Medicare, Medicaid During Senate Confirmation Hearing

MedPage Today story.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.' statements before  Senate Finance Committee  Wednesday revealed  concerning lack  knowledge about  major health programs ' oversee, should   confirmed  HHS secretary.

On several occasions during  3.5-hour hearing, Kennedy seemed  conflate Medicare, Medicaid,  Medicare Advantage,  appeared  mistakenly refer   Affordable Care Act health exchanges.

"Medicaid   working  Americans,  ' specifically  working   target population,"  said  response  questions from Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD (R-La.),  physician,  asked   what ways  would improve  healthcare delivery system.

"I'  Medicare Advantage  I' very happy with ," Kennedy replied. "Most people    Medicaid   happy. The premiums   high,  deductibles   high,  networks  narrow."

In fact, Medicaid plans generally   have premiums,   they , under federal  they must  kept  based  income.

Asked  Cassidy what reforms  would propose, Kennedy replied, "Well, I ' have  proposal  dismantling  program." He later gave vague responses  Cassidy' question about   would improve programs  dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries -- often with complex health issues --   eligible  Medicare  because  their  income,  also eligible  Medicaid.

"Well, dual eligibles   right  served very well into  system," Kennedy replied. "And  know I suppose  answer  that   make sure that  programs  consolidated, they' integrated,   care  integrated. I look forward  working with , Dr. Cassidy,  making sure that  take good care  people."

Cassidy then asked   proposed  integrate  programs. "Does Medicare  more? Medicare  less? Medicaid  more? Medicaid  less? How    that?"

"I'  exactly sure, because I'   there. I mean,   difficult  integrate them ..."  replied, ultimately saying, "I   know  answer  that. I look forward  exploring options."

Kennedy also said that Medicare beneficiaries would "rather   Medicare Advantage because  offers very good services. People ' afford . It' much more expensive."

In fact, MA plan beneficiaries generally    very  premiums  choose their plans because    -existent upfront costs. However,   true that MA plans generally cost  trust fund   more than   same beneficiaries were  traditional Medicare -- $82 billion more  2023 according   Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.

At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid  "fully paid    federal government," when  fact   paid through    state  federal money, with states contributing between 17%  41%  fiscal year 2023. That'  important concept  understand, since each Medicaid program' coverage  eligibility requirements  vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs   HHS agencies.

The American Public Health Association (APHA)   American Academy  Pediatrics (AAP) held  joint media briefing Wednesday after  hearing, questioning Kennedy' fitness    agency, which  13 separate  important divisions, thousands  programs,  80,000 employees.

"... [H] demonstrated that    have    health experience,   many   answers,   that    ... dearth  management experience," said Georges Benjamin, MD, executive director  APHA.

Benjamin noted that ' important  someone  this position   "rigorous about scientific evidence,  cherry pick,  understand things like healthcare financing, which  truly   know  difference between Medicaid   health exchanges."

"He talked about copayments  premiums that were  high  Medicaid when Medicaid doesn' have premiums  start with," Benjamin said. Also, " made  statement about  fact that NIH (National Institutes  Health) doesn' spend    money  chronic diseases, which  absolutely  true."

Benjamin  asked -- given  number  Kennedy' misstatements -- whether   this point   process should  better informed about Medicare  Medicaid,  problems with programs  dual eligibles.

"He   understand   that," Benjamin replied. "And  know, this   rocket science. ... [HHS] does    things,  I said earlier that  nation spends $5 trillion [ healthcare]  '   bottom   other industrialized nations  terms  health outcomes. There'    reasons  that,   '     that because  really doesn' know. He doesn' even understand  basics  what  department does."

Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor   Frameworks Institute, which conducts research  social issues  language, said during  briefing that Kennedy conveyed "quite   instances  disinformation."

Multiple times,  suggested "that most Americans   happy with Medicaid, although some   comments suggested that perhaps   unclear  what Medicaid . ... In fact,  know that more than 8  10 Medicaid enrollees rate  overall performance  Medicaid positively, according   2023 KFF poll."

Susan Kressly, MD, president  AAP,  asked about Kennedy' statement   committee that, "Most experts agree today, even  people    back then, COVID vaccines  inappropriate  6-year- children  basically have zero risk  COVID."

Such remarks, along with Kennedy' often-repeated opposition  other vaccinations -- which   denies -- raise concerns that  would find ways  discourage immunizations, perhaps   requiring that they  covered   essential benefit  Medicare  health plans.

Kressly said that Kennedy  wrong,  children  experience complications  COVID months after they recover,  said. Also, they "tend   spreaders  infectious illnesses because they'  very good  blowing their nose  keeping their germs  themselves," which  affect their family members, schools,  communities,  said.

"COVID   something that does  affect children  ,"  said. "In fact,   enormous impacts."

In Settling Fraud Case, N.Y. Medicare Advantage Insurer, CEO Will Pay Up  $100M

MedPage Today story.

A western New York health insurance provider  seniors   CEO   medical analytics  have agreed    total    $100 million  settle Justice Department allegations  fraudulent billing  health conditions that were exaggerated  didn' exist.

Independent Health Association  Buffalo, which operates  Medicare Advantage plans, will    $98 million. Betsy Gaffney, CEO  medical records review company DxID, will  $2 million, according   settlement agreement. Neither admitted wrongdoing.

"Today' result sends  clear message   Medicare Advantage community that  United States will take appropriate action against those  knowingly submit inflated claims  reimbursement," Michael Granston,  Department  Justice (DOJ) deputy assistant attorney general, said  announcing  settlement  December 20.

Frank Sava,  spokesperson  Independent Health, said   statement: "The assertions   DOJ  allegations only,  there  been  determination  liability. This settlement    admission   wrongdoing;  instead allows   avoid  further disruption, expense,  uncertainty  litigation   matter that  lingered  over  decade."

Under  settlement, Independent Health will make "guaranteed payments"  $34.5 million  installments from 2024 through 2028. Whether  pays  maximum amount   settlement will depend   health plan' financial performance.

Michael Ronickher,  attorney  whistleblower Teresa Ross, called  settlement "historic," saying    largest payment    health plan based solely   whistleblower' fraud allegations. It also     first  accuse  data mining firm  helping  health plan overcharge.

The settlement   latest   whirl  whistleblower actions alleging billing fraud   Medicare Advantage insurer. Medicare Advantage plans  private health plans that cover more than 33 million members, making  over half   people eligible  Medicare. They  expected  grow further under  incoming Trump administration.

But  Medicare Advantage  gained popularity, regulators  CMS have struggled  prevent health plans from exaggerating  sick patients   boost their revenues.

Whistleblowers such  Ross,  former medical coding professional, have helped  government claw back hundreds  millions  dollars  overpayments tied  alleged coding abuses. Ross will receive  least $8.2 million, according   Justice Department.

Ross said that CMS "created  bounty"  health plans that added medical diagnosis codes  they reviewed patients' charts --  whether those codes were accurate   "didn' seem  bother some people."

"Billions  dollars  being paid   CMS  diagnoses that ' exist," Ross told KFF Health News   interview.

Data Mining

DOJ' civil complaint, filed  September 2021,  unusual  targeting  data analytics venture --    executive --  allegedly ginning  bogus payments.

DxID specialized  mining electronic medical records  capture  diagnoses  patients -- pocketing   20%   money  generated   health plan, according   suit, which said Independent Health used  firm from 2010 through 2017. DxID shut down  2021.

Gaffney pitched  services  Medicare Advantage plans  " attractive  pass ," according   Justice Department complaint.

"There   upfront ,  '  paid until   paid   work   percentage   actual proven recoveries," Gaffney said, according   complaint. Timothy Hoover,  attorney  Gaffney, said   statement that  settlement "   admission   liability  Ms. Gaffney. The settlement simply resolves  dispute  provides closure   parties."

'A Ton  Money'

CMS uses  complex formula that pays health plans higher rates  sicker patients  less  people  good health. Health plans must retain medical records that document  diagnoses they highlight  reimbursement.

Independent Health violated those rules  billing Medicare   range  medical conditions that either were exaggerated   supported  patient medical files, such  billing  treating chronic depression that  been resolved, according   complaint. In  case,  87-year-   coded  having "major depressive disorder" even though  medical records indicated  problem  "transient," according   complaint.

DxID also cited chronic kidney disease  renal failure "  absence   documentation suggesting that  patient suffered from those conditions," according   complaint. Past conditions, such  heart attacks, that required  current treatment, also were coded, according   DOJ.

The suit alleges that Gaffney said renal failure diagnoses were "worth    money  IH [Independent Health]   majority  people (over) 70 have   some level."

Ross filed  whistleblower case  2012 against Group Health Cooperative  Seattle,    nation' oldest managed-care groups.

Ross,  former medical coding manager there, alleged that DxID submitted more than $30 million  disease claims -- many  which were  valid --  behalf  Group Health  2010  2011. For instance, Ross alleged that  plan billed  "major depression"   patient described   doctor  having  "amazingly sunny disposition."

Group Health,  known   Kaiser Foundation Health Plan  Washington, denied wrongdoing. But  settled  civil case  November 2020  agreeing   $6.3 million. The DOJ filed  second complaint  2021, against Independent Health, which also used DxID' services.

Ross said  lost   after  suit became public  2019   unable  secure another    medical coding field.

"It  rough  times,    through ,"  said. Ross, 60, said    "happily retired."

False Claims

Whistleblowers  under  False Claims Act,  federal  dating   Civil War that allows private citizens  expose fraud against  government  share   recovery.

At least  dozen such suits, some dating  2009, have targeted Medicare Advantage plans  overstating  severity  medical conditions,  practice known   industry  "upcoding." Previous settlements from such suits have totaled more than $600 million.

The whistleblowers have played   role  holding health insurers accountable.

While dozens  CMS audits have concluded that health plans overcharged  government,  agency  done little  recoup money   U.S. Treasury.

In  surprise action  late January 2023, CMS announced that  would settle   fraction   estimated tens  millions  dollars  overpayments uncovered through  audits dating  2011   impose major financial penalties  health plans until  round  audits  2018 payments, which have    done. Exactly  much plans will   paying back  unclear.

"I think CMS should  doing more," said Max Voldman,  attorney  represents Ross.

What Is Spondylolisthesis,  Spine Condition Reported  Plague Luigi Mangione?

reportedly  spinal surgery  chronic back pain caused  spondylolisthesis.

Spondylolisthesis occurs when  vertebra slips forward   place onto  vertebra below, explained Jessica Stark, MD, spine surgeon  UTHealth Houston. This slippage,  sequela  arthritis, happens most often   lumbar spine    pressure   nerves around  spine.

"Really arthritic backs  have varying degrees  spondylolisthesis throughout  spine, just because  joints have become overgrown  slipped  different spots," Stark told MedPage Today.

Pain levels depend   degree  slip    spondylolisthesis came  . When patients come  with  condition, Stark begins  assessing  grade  severity   much  condition  affecting  patient' life. Many report having back   pain  numbness.

"I always tell patients that pain  kind   warning sign from  nerve compression,  that numbness  weakness  actual nerve damage," Stark said. "When    weakness  really when  start  worry, because that' when that nerve  getting pretty severely damaged  sometimes, especially with certain nerves, once they   much pressure  them,    weak that  nerve actually ' heal itself anymore."

She noted that people  develop spondylolisthesis  various reasons.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis,  most common form, occurs from wear  tear   bones rubbing against each other over time. Most   time this presents   50  older. Some people, like those   manual labor  play impact sports, have more wear  tear  their bodies from these high impact activities   more likely   arthritis  herniated discs earlier  well  develop spondylolisthesis. Women  African Americans  also more likely  develop degenerative spondylolisthesis, according   American Academy  Orthopaedic Surgeons.

Those born with congenital pars defects  fractures -- abnormalities   part   bone   back   spine that keeps  joints  place --  have their bones slip   earlier , perhaps even  their teen years. Traumatic fractures   pars, stemming most often from vehicle crashes  falls,  also lead  spondylolisthesis.

"Acute injuries, like traumas, obviously  more injury  their nerve because  happens    sudden,  their nerves haven' been stretched   long time  they ' have that kind  protective nerve root healing that' slowly going ," Stark explained.

Treatment often begins with core-strengthening physical therapy  reduce pressure   spine, long acting anti-inflammatories like celecoxib (Celebrex)  meloxicam,  potentially muscle relaxers  nerve pain medication like gabapentin (Neurontin). For some, this level  intervention  sufficient.

But   condition doesn' improve  worsens  6 weeks,  next step  injections given every  months. Stark said this typically involves  lumbar epidural steroid injection that  anti-inflammatory effects with lidocaine  short-term numbing pain relief. Like other similar injections,  lumbar epidural steroid injection works best  first time  becomes less efficacious with each injection.

Surgically stabilizing  spine with four screws   rods   last resort  definitive treatment. Stark said most surgeons also clean   disc    "some type  interbody, meaning cage, into  disc space  allow  anterior fusion  well, because '    stress  those screws,   rods,  that  fail over time." This gives  intervention  better chance  holding,  explained.

After  vertebrae  stabilized,  spine' first point  movement   level higher, which slightly increases  risk  arthritis  that level. About 20 years after surgery, some people need  second    level above  first.

The silver lining   difficult condition, Stark said,  that some   most effective treatments  relatively .

"I   this through  small incision that' less than  inch,"  said. "I think that' nice that    that --  that wasn'  option 10 years ."

Long COVID Patients Frustrated That Federal Research Hasn' Found New Treatments

MedPage Today story.

Erica Hayes, 40,   felt healthy since November 2020 when  first fell  with COVID.

Hayes   sick  work,    spent much   last 4 years sitting   beige couch, often curled  under  electric blanket.

"My blood flow  sucks,   hands   feet  freezing. Even  I' sweating,  toes  cold," said Hayes,  lives  Western Pennsylvania. She misses feeling well enough  play with  9-year-   attend  17-year- ' baseball games.

Along with claiming  lives  1.2 million Americans,  COVID-19 pandemic  been described   mass disabling event. Hayes    millions  Americans  suffer from long COVID. Depending   patient,  condition   someone  energy, scramble  autonomic nervous system,   their memory, among many other symptoms. In addition   brain   chronic fatigue, Hayes' constellation  symptoms includes frequent hives  migraines. Also,  tongue  constantly swollen  .

"I'  multiple doctors look    tell  they ' know what' going ," Hayes said about  tongue.

Estimates  prevalence range considerably, depending   researchers define long COVID   given study,   CDC puts   17 million adults.

Despite long COVID' vast reach,  federal government' investment  researching  disease --   tune  $1.15 billion   December --    failed  bring   treatments  market.

This disappoints  angers  patient community,    National Institutes  Health (NIH) should focus  ways  stop their suffering instead  simply trying  understand  they' suffering.

"It' unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began,  still ' have  FDA-approved drug," said Meighan Stone, executive director   Long COVID Campaign,  patient- advocacy organization. Stone  among several people with long COVID  spoke   workshop hosted   NIH  September where patients, clinicians,  researchers discussed their priorities  frustrations around  agency' approach  long COVID research.

Some doctors  researchers  also critical   agency' research initiative, called RECOVER,  Researching COVID  Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing  treating long COVID must rely  hunches  guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief  research  development with  VA St. Louis Healthcare System.

"What [RECOVER] lacks, really,  clarity  vision  clarity  purpose," said Al-Aly, saying  agrees that  NIH   enough time  money  produce more meaningful progress.

Now  NIH  starting  determine   allocate  additional $662 million  funding  long COVID research, $300 million  which  earmarked  clinical trials. These funds will  allocated over  next 4 years. At    October, RECOVER issued  request  clinical trial ideas that look  potential therapies, including medications, saying  goal  " work rapidly, collaboratively,  transparently  advance treatments  long COVID."

This turn suggests  NIH  begun  respond  patients. This  stirred cautious optimism among those   that  agency' approach  long COVID  lacked urgency   search  effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million  down payment. She warns ' going  take   more money  help people like Hayes regain some degree  health. "There really   burden  make  this lost time ," Stone said.

The NIH told KFF Health News  NPR  email that  recognizes  urgency  finding treatments. But   that, there needs    understanding   biological mechanisms that  making people sick, which  difficult   with post-infectious conditions.

That'    funded research into  long COVID affects lung function,  trying  understand  only some people  afflicted with  condition.

Good Science Takes Time

In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion   NIH  launch RECOVER, raising hopes   long COVID patient community.

Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER' goal   better understand long COVID   disease  that clinical trials  potential treatments would come later.

According  RECOVER' website,   funded eight clinical trials  test  safety  effectiveness   experimental treatment  intervention. Just   those trials  published results.

On  other hand, RECOVER  supported more than 200 observational studies, such  research   long COVID affects pulmonary function   which symptoms  most common. And  initiative  funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus   basic cellular  molecular mechanisms  long COVID.

RECOVER' website says this research    crucial insights   risk factors  developing long COVID   understanding   disease interacts with preexisting conditions.

It notes that observational studies  important  helping scientists  design  launch evidence-based clinical trials.

Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD,  -principal investigator   RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort  New York University (NYU). And long COVID   "exceedingly complicated" illness that appears  affect nearly every organ system,  said.

This makes  more difficult  study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms  body   many ways, with widely variable symptoms, ' harder  identify precise targets  treatment.

"I also will remind  that ' only 3, 4 years into this pandemic  most people," Horwitz said. "We' been spending much more money than this, yearly,  30, 40 years  other conditions."

NYU received nearly $470 million  RECOVER funds  2021, which  institution  using  spearhead  collection  data  biospecimens from   40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000  enrolled  .

This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists  understand what  happening biologically  people  ' recover after  initial infection --  that will help determine which clinical trials  treatments  worth undertaking.

"Simply trying treatments because they  available without  evidence about whether   they   effective reduces  likelihood  successful trials    patients  risk  harm,"  said.

Delayed Hopes  Incremental Progress?

The NIH told KFF Health News  NPR that patients  caregivers have been central  RECOVER from  beginning, "playing critical roles  designing studies  clinical trials, responding  surveys, serving  governance  publication groups,  guiding  initiative." But  consensus from patient advocacy groups  that RECOVER should have done more  prioritize clinical trials from  outset. Patients also  RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities  experiences when determining which studies  fund.

RECOVER  scored some gains, said JD Davids, -director  Long COVID Justice. This includes findings  differences  long COVID between adults  kids. But Davids said  NIH shouldn' have named  initiative "RECOVER," since  wasn' designed   streamlined effort  develop treatments.

"The name'  little cruel  misleading,"  said.

RECOVER' initial allocation  $1.15 billion probably wasn' enough  develop   medication  treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, -director   University  Pennsylvania' Healthcare Transformation Institute.

But,  said,  results  preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies  fund more studies  drug development  test  existing drugs influence  patient' immune response.

And though  NYU biobank  been impactful, Emanuel said there needs   more focus   existing drugs influence immune response.

He said some clinical trials that RECOVER  funded  "ridiculous," because they' focused  symptom amelioration,  example  study  benefits  over--counter medication  improve sleep. Other studies looked  -pharmacological interventions, such  exercise  "brain training"  help with cognitive .

People with long COVID  this type  clinical research contributes  what many describe   "gaslighting" they experience from doctors,  sometimes blame  patient' symptoms  anxiety  depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID   real illness with  physiological basis.

"You'   whim  somebody    even understand  spectrum  long COVID," Sweeney said.

Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments

Since there  still  long COVID treatments approved   FDA, anything  physician prescribes  classified  either experimental --  unproven treatments --   -label    drug approved  other conditions. This means patients  struggle   insurance  cover prescriptions.

Michael Brode, MD, medical director  UT Health Austin' Post-COVID-19 Program -- said  writes many appeal letters. And some people   their  treatment.

For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, -dose naltrexone,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy   promising treatments,  said.

For hyperbaric oxygen,  small, randomized controlled studies show improvements   chronic fatigue  brain  that often plague long COVID patients. The theory  that higher oxygen concentration  increased  pressure  help heal tissues that were damaged during  COVID infection.

However,  --pocket cost   series  sessions   hyperbaric chamber    much  $8,000, Brode said.

"Am I going  look  patient     , 'You need  spend that money   unproven treatment'?"  said. "I ' want  hype   treatment that  still experimental. But I also ' want  hide ."

There'  host  pharmaceuticals that have promising -label uses  long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president  chief scientific officer   Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, ' collaborating   clinical study that repurposes  HIV drugs  treat long COVID.

Proal said research  treatments  move forward based  what' already understood about  disease. For instance,  said that scientists have evidence -- partly   RECOVER research -- that some patients continue  harbor small amounts  viral material after  COVID infection. She   received RECOVER funds   researching antivirals.

But    range  possible treatments   millions suffering  --   develop  drugs specifically targeting long COVID -- clinical trials  needed. And that requires money.

HHS Employees Sort Out Return--Office Mandate

MedPage Today story.

Employees  HHS   various -agencies  struggling  figure    implement President Donald Trump' executive order requiring them  report -person  their work sites full-time,    changes will affect them.

An Early Executive Order

The -person work requirement  outlined   executive order signed  President Trump  January 20,  first   office. The -paragraph order stated that "Heads   departments  agencies   executive branch  government shall,  soon  practicable, take  necessary steps  terminate remote work arrangements  require employees  return  work -person  their respective duty stations   full-time basis, provided that  department  agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary."

The order  further explained   January 27 memo  agency heads from both  Office  Personnel Management (OPM)   Office  Management  Budget (OMB). That memo directed agency heads  submit  later than February 7 plans that will "describe  steps  agency will take  revise telework agreements   eligible employees including major milestones  implementation"  "provide timelines   return   eligible employees  -person work  expeditiously  possible." Agencies must also explain their plans  getting those   working remotely full-time back   office, especially those  live more than 50 miles from their duty stations,  outline  exceptions they intend  grant.

Trump   alone   antipathy  teleworking  federal workers. Last December, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) released  report stating that only 6%  federal workers were   office full-time;  report  titled "Out  Office: Bureaucrats   beach   bubble baths    office buildings." Ernst' percentage  very much  odds with  2024 OMB report -- which  since been removed from  OMB website -- that found that 54%  federal employees work   office full-time, while  other 46%   federal workforce  telework eligible, according   story   Meritalk website. Only 10%  federal employees – 228,000 people –   fully remote jobs.

Generally Popular With Both Parties

Overall, however, telework actually  been popular  both sides   aisle, Max Stier, president  CEO   Partnership  Public Service, said last month   phone call with reporters: "There  been bipartisan support  telework   federal space  many, many years, because ' been shown  -- when well-applied -- provide both  better performance  improved ability  recruit  best talent  federal positions." The Partnership  Public Service says     build " better government   stronger democracy."

In  past  years, "there' obviously been  push    move people   federal space back into  office," Stier continued. "The Biden administration actually pushed aggressively    make that happen. ... Some organizations like  Patent  Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know ' really important  understand that  have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even -pandemic,   wouldn' want  disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences   American people."

The -office order comes   General Services Administration announced plans  significantly reduce  federal government' real estate footprint. "One   things that  government  become  more efficient with respect  cost,  terms   physical footprint,   result  increased   telework  remote work," said Stier. "So those things    conflict with each other,  certainly '  important  understand  transition needs   organization."

Like everyone else   federal workforce, HHS' more than 80,000 employees -- several  whom spoke  MedPage Today  condition  anonymity --  trying  figure    back--work order will  implemented  their specific situation. The agency consists  workers assigned   HHS headquarters office  Washington  well  10 regional offices spread throughout  U.S.,  lingering logistical questions remain. Some  have previously worked   Washington headquarters,  example,  there  likely  enough interior space  parking  accommodate    employees  everyone  assigned there were  return full-time.

One employee working   different location said they  heard that supervisors were going  have  return  work full-time sooner than -supervisory employees,  that there might still  some " " telework agreements. There    enough space  everyone    their building,  employee said.

Still another employee said that their colleagues were "none  pleased"  hear about  back--office-full-time requirement, noting that  rule appeared  supersede other arrangements  which people could,  instance, work four 10-hour days    fifth  . "This   imperious, dictatorial, - approach  management,"  person said. "It'  about efficiency; ' just about vindictiveness. There  ways  achieve  overall goal  serving  American people well,  this   that."

Changes  Work/Life Balance

With this change, "people' work/life balance  about   completely tipped over,"  person continued. They noted that " flexibility  remote work allowed them  create lives where they were much more productive  parents  still  their work done;  they     carpool  3 .., they could  that  work into  evening. I would  emails from people  were still working  7  8 .. But  '  that  '   office 5 days  week with inflexible workplace rules."

Another employee said that telework made  easier  work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, " would take   hour   into work   morning  maybe 90 minutes  longer   home   afternoon," they said, explaining that they worked  7 ..--3:30 .. shift. But with telework, "I could work before 7  after 3:30,  that  happened commonly -- things come   require more than just  8 hours that    Monday through Friday."

One thing that might affect whether  when HHS employees return   office full-time   collective bargaining agreements that employee unions have with  federal government. "In  OPM memo, they indicated that there were some issues that need   resolved through  collective bargaining process before employees that were represented   unions could actually return   office,"  employee added. Several unions, including  American Federation  Government Employees   National Treasury Employees Union, represent different swaths  HHS employees.

Buckingham left  band  1987, returning  1996. The last time  band reunited, however,   2018-2019 tour,  rest   members kicked Buckingham ,    result,  sued them.

NEW YORK -- There  pioneering music figures,  then there  Ozzy Osbourne,  larger-than-life frontman  Black Sabbath, whose personal mythology  eclipsed only   strength  immortality   songs.

A godfather  force  heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday  76, just weeks after  last performance.

The English icon' idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations  metalheads, both through  work   reins  Black Sabbath    solo career. Across  repertoire, there  songs with total global ubiquity  lesser-known innovations with  unique, spooky aesthetic quality.

To celebrate Osbourne’ life  legacy, ' selected just   songs that made  , from timeless tunes    left--center selections.

Read   then listen     tracks   Spotify playlist.

It would   challenge  name  more immediately recognizable guitar riff than   that launches Black Sabbath' 1970 megahit “Iron Man.” It transcends  metal genre —  -timer heard around  world   guitar stores everywhere.

One   great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath' “War Pigs”   rare moment where hippies  metalheads  agree: “Politicians hide themselves away / They only started   / Why should they    fight?” Osbourne sings   bridge.

Osbourne' heaviest performances   least partially indebted  Black Sabbath' bassist  lyricist Terry “Geezer” Butler,  there  perhaps  better example than “Children   Grave,”  single from  band' 1971 album, “Master  Reality.” “Must  world live   shadow  atomic fear?” Osbourne embodies Butler' words,  sonic fist lifted   . “Can they   fight  peace  will they disappear?”

Black Sabbath were   creative    time period leading   “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,”  opening track from their 1973 album   same name. It' almost hard  believe  —  song features   their best-known riffs,   chorus features some truly ascendant vocals.

Would  world know what  vibraslap sounds like without  immediately recognizable introduction  Osbourne' first solo single, “Crazy Train?” To call   classic  almost  disservice —    addicting tune, complete with chugging guitars  Cold War- fears.

Another classic  from Osbourne' debut solo album, “Blizzard Of Ozz” — released  year after Osbourne  fired from Black Sabbath   legendary excesses, —  arena rock anthem “Mr. Crowley” pays tribute   famed English occultist Aleister Crowley  features Deep Purple' Don Airey  keyboard.

The donation will come from Miranda,  Miranda Family  Miranda Family Fund,   “Hamilton” cast.

It seemed like  fitting tribute  “Hamilton”   inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though  recognizes that Hamilton wouldn’ have called himself  immigrant.

“His narrative   country kind  mirrors that   immigrant story,” Miranda said. “He   grow  here. He didn’ come from England. He came from  Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And  really helped shape this country.”

Miranda  exclusively reveal some plans   special, invite-only “Hamilton” anniversary show   preshow reception that  will host. Fans already know  possibilities after  special “Hamilton” medley   Tonys  June. Even  audience will  “stacked,”  said, since every actor   ever performed during  show' Broadway  will  invited     audience  watch  show’ current Broadway cast that night. “We’ working  something special   curtain call  another nice special thing after that,” Miranda said. “That’ about  I  .”

The bulk   invites have gone  winners selected from  Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated  least $10   Immigrants coalition. A  dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500  $10,000, will  available Thursday through  Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going   coalition.

“One  America’ greatest exports --  least   growing  --   immigration narrative,” Miranda said. “So many people I know… came  this country from somewhere else seeking  better life  then helped make this country better  being here. And I believe that’    greatest promises,   greatest things about  American experiment,  I’ continue  fight  that  support organizations that  helping that cause.”

And  organizations that will benefit from  donations generated   “Hamilton” 10th anniversary, better known  #Hamilten,   donations  encouragement  sorely needed .

Since  start   second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved  make good  “Mass Deportation Now!” promises from  campaign. His administration  encouraged U.S. Immigration  Customs Enforcement  detain  deport people quickly, even  countries where they have never been,  order  rein  illegal immigration.

Hispanic Federation President  CEO Frankie Miranda,  relation  Lin-Manuel Miranda, said   heartened   more than 125,000 people  have donated   “Hamilton” fundraiser. “I think    beginning  what could   incredible movement  philanthropy  individual donors basically saying, ‘Enough  enough’,”  said. “We have seen  also   different demonstrations  people around  country where they  expressing their concern  their frustration    streets.”

Hispanic Federation  already lost millions  federal funding,   Trump administration cuts support  workplace development initiatives  environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He  also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from  Trump administration. “We need bold ideas like ‘Hamilton’ where everybody feels that they  stand behind ,”  said.

Aarti Kohli, executive director   Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said  donations would help  group continue  provide community legal services  individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like  challenge   Trump executive order seeking  strip away birthright citizenship from some children born   United States.

“At this time, when  many people  afraid  speak   support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing    ‘Hamilton’ platform just shows real leadership  bravery,” Kohli said. “And I’ hoping that more donors will step   support  sector. We   firewall between authoritarianism  democracy.”

Kica Matos, president   National Immigration Law Center, said  nonprofit plans    donations from  coalition  support  Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants  their rights  uses    “ bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried   this administration.”

Matos sees    “full circle” moment   funding generated  “ story     nation’ Founding Fathers  himself   indigent immigrant,  through   grit, determination   brilliance, worked   .” “He  somebody  thought deeply about this  nation’ democracy,”  added. “What better   honor Hamilton   express  gratitude  these resources?”

For Lin-Manuel Miranda,  fact that people remain fascinated  “Hamilton” 10 years later also leaves  feeling grateful.

And  remains surprised   resonance   line “Immigrants: We    done,”  line shared   show  Hamilton  French military officer Marquis  Lafayette   Battle  Yorktown.

“I thought     deal,”  said. “But from  moment   performed  stage,  audience reaction   joyous  just  utterance  that simple fact. It’    things that just heartens   gives  hope. In these dark times,  still gets   cheer.”

The cheering still requires  show   extra measures  music  wait   audience  calm down before continuing with  song “Yorktown.” Miranda attributes    fact that  many Americans  only    generations away from  immigrant.

“It’  same reason  that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered  military parade happening   same ,”  said. “There  still    people  believe  basic decency  treating people  come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.”

NPR stations also  millions  dollars  federal money   music licensing fees. Now many will have  renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music,   more limited variety  music,  outlets where music discovery    part  their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96%   classical music broadcast   United States   NPR stations. “That  essentially taking  entire  form   public access,”  said.

The affair transcends violins  piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from  heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar  Berserker posted  call  social media  fans   attention  what  going  with public media.

But donations aren' going  fill  hole left   loss  federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned  lobbying Congress  restore some   funding through  appropriations process  next year' budget.

Public media ' getting  help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their  outlays  public media this year, either  budget  political reasons.

Gov. Ron DeSantis,  example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers   aside  public broadcasters   before  state' budget took effect  July 1. “Done  Florida,” DeSantis responded  social media   Trump post calling public broadcasting  “monstrosity” that should  defunded.

Back  Alaska, KMXT public radio station’ general manager, Jared Griffin, called  Senate vote  “devastating  punch.” He estimated that  cuts would amount  22%  KMXT’ budget. Griffin said  station’ board  already agreed   plan  furlough staff members    month,  ’ taking  50%  .

The station covers Kodiak Island, home     nation’ largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.

“We have   into  savings while  figure  what KMXT  going  look like over  next  months, Griffin said. ”At least   next year ’  fine  ’ probably going  have  look  leasing space   building  other organizations  help fill that .”

U.S. President Donald Trump  vowed  keep "woke AI" models   Washington   turn  country into  "AI export powerhouse" through  signing  three artificial intelligence-focused executive orders  Wednesday.

It turns  some   hurdles facing broader British retail  affecting Duck World, .

Alongside  business partner Filip Perkon,  opened  first  Duck World' shops — dubbed "nests" —  January 2023 with  mission  "spread happiness." But sticky U.K. inflation, national wage increases  business rate relief cuts have been piling   pressure, with Fedotova admitting that Duck World    raise prices across  product lines  recent months.

On  brief stakeout   Duck World establishments, CNBC observed shoppers ranging from rambunctious toddlers  middle-aged tourists. One customer told CNBC that  latest purchase   duck   kids    target practice with their water guns. "I think some  these shops  least have  fairly loyal customer base," retail analyst  JDM Retail CEO Jonathan De Mello told CNBC  phone, noting  certain immunity that collectibles have   face  macroeconomic downturns. "Duck World    those sorts  businesses." De Mello suggested Duck World could achieve  "extremely high" return   rubber duck sales,  "gross margin will  70% minimum — maybe 80-85%, thereabout," under  assumption    material  production costs.

Tariffs   child' play

Most  Duck World' products  designed   U.K. —  many  manufactured  China, Fedotova said. The business , therefore, affected   retaliatory -- between Washington  Beijing that brought tariffs into  triple-digit percentages  April. "We  looking  alternatives [ importing from China]," Fedotova said,  added that producing  products   U.S. just doesn'  .

Yet even outside  Duck World, rubber ducks continue  appeal  take pride  place  many  London' numerous souvenir stores.

"Such value incorporates aspects such  feelings  happiness, belonginess   group  social interaction with other collectors.

"What happens when  become less fashionable? …   still afford  rent?" De Mello questioned.

"[I  surprised ]  number  times, even when  hear   passing, that people would post  Twitter, 'Are they money laundering?'" Fedotova said, categorically denying  allegations. "It' funny that people   quick  accuse." Skepticism  small businesses popping   Britain' high street  mounted over  years after some U.S.-style "candy shops" were linked  illicit activities. Local authorities have been cracking down  such establishments, particularly   around London' high-traffic Oxford Street —  less than 20-minute walk away from Duck World' flagship store  Charing Cross.

Britain' competition regulators  Wednesday took    mobile ecosystems  Apple  Google, pushing   companies  make changes  areas like their  stores. On Wednesday,  Competition  Markets Authority proposed designating  U.S. tech giants  having  "strategic market status"  SMS, after opening  investigation into  matter  January. This designation  given   large company that  "substantial  entrenched market power"   "position  strategic significance" with respect   digital activity   U.K. The CMA  force firms that  branded  having SMS  change  stop specific behaviors  practices  order  address competition concerns. Apple  Google both took issue with  CMA' proposals, effectively saying they would    user security  consumers overall.

What   CMA taken issue with?

Britain' regulator focused  investigating Apple  Google' mobile operating systems,  store  browser. One aspect   investigation looked  whether there  barriers that  prevent other competitors from offering rival products  services   U.S. tech giants' mobile platforms. Another part   probe examined whether Apple  Google  using their position  operating systems,  distribution  browsers  favor   apps  services. And  final aspect   investigation studied whether Apple  Google require developers  sign   "unfair terms  conditions"  order  distribute their apps   respective  stores. The CMA  Wednesday said consumers  businesses have raised concerns about different issues across   companies' mobile ecosystems. But some  these include "inconsistent  unpredictable  review processes"  "inconsistent  store search rankings" that  favor  tech giants'  apps. The British regulator also took      30% commission charged   firms  some - purchases  restrictions  developers telling customers about cheaper ways     subscribe outside   . As part  Google  Apple' review process  allow apps   their  stores, developers raised concerns that  tech companies could have access  commercially sensitive data  their competitors,  CMA said. Google' Android operating system commands just over 61% market share   U.K., while Apple' iOS  just over  38%, according  Kantar data. Google runs  Google Play store  Chrome browser,  Apple   App Store  Safari browser.

What changes does  CMA want?

The CMA  laid  immediate changes that  wants  , alongside some longer-term steps. The regulator said that  wants Apple  review apps  distribution   "fair, objective  transparent manner." This could include remedies such  Apple explaining delays  rejections  creating  avenue  businesses  raise concerns about  process. Apple could also  made  publish  methodology    ranks apps   App Store. The CMA  laid  similar remedies  Google. The regulator  looking   Apple  Google  make  easy  users   steered  developers outside       services  products, thus avoiding their respective - purchase . The CMA  also looking into ways  make  easier  users  transfer data between Apple' iOS  Google' Android  make switching easier. For next year,  CMA said   still looking  whether  require Apple  allow alternative  stores  iOS   company' iPad software. The regulator also said   exploring whether  force Apple  allow users  download apps directly from  developer'  website,  practice known  "sideloading."

Apple  Google react

Apple said   statement that  proposals from  U.K. "would undermine  privacy  security protections that  users have come  expect, hamper  ability  innovate,  force   give away  technology  free  foreign competitors," "We will continue  engage with  regulator  make sure they fully understand these risks." Google' Senior Director  Competition Oliver Bethell noted that both  Google Chrome browser  Android' operating system  built  open-source code. "These offerings enable great choice, security  innovation  users. That'  today' announcement  both disappointing  unwarranted," Bethell said. The Google executive highlighted ways  which Android  helped British developers   economy. "It  therefore crucial that   regulation  evidence-based, proportionate  does  become  roadblock  growth   U.K We remain committed  constructive engagement with  CMA   duration  this process," Bethell said.

This report  from this week' CNBC' The China Connection newsletter, which brings  insights  analysis  what' driving  world' second-largest economy. Each week, ' explore  biggest business stories  China, give  lowdown  market moves  help      week ahead. Like what  ? You  subscribe here.

The  story

China' economy requires more than short-term stimulus, even  deflationary pressures intensify. That'  message from economists, including those   highly regarded Peking University' Guanghua School  Management. Academics  Beijing'  schools often share recommendations with policymakers. It'  that  persistent drop  prices should  overlooked,  that they' signaling  need  more serious changes — just  China prepares  "15th five-year plan." It'  national social  economic development blueprint   period from 2026  2030. China  wrapping   14th such plan this year   expected  reveal details   next five years   coming months. "When  talk about  15th five-year plan,   issue    grow productivity," Liu Qiao, dean   Guanghua School   finance professor, told  last week. He' referring specifically  "total factor productivity,"  measure   economy' productivity gains from technology, innovation, economies  scale,  policies, without adding more labor  capital. According   International Monetary Fund, China' total TFP growth fell from 4.1%   2000s  2.6%   2010s,  entered  state  decline from 2006. Liu believes China' TFP needs  grow   least 2%  more. To that , tech innovation   important part   upcoming five-year plan, Liu said. But  added that institutional reform  just  important. The Chinese Communist Party' grip   state   institutions enables   exert greater influence over  economy than   U.S.,  example. "80%  China' total factor productivity comes from institutional reform," economist Zhou Tianyong wrote   opinion piece  Chinese business news magazine Caixin, which CNBC translated. Zhou   former vice president   International Strategy Institute   Central Party School, China' higher education institution  training party leaders. Zhou pointed  that  textbook definition  technology     boost productivity doesn' necessarily apply  China, where business  consumer interests  constrained  certain areas. "Without economic system reform, there will   medium--high-speed growth." All this  seem rather academic   average markets discussion more focused  deflation, industrial overcapacity  spillover into trade tensions. But public debate  limited  China. In  country where leaders operate  building consensus behind closed doors, policy signals come largely from  phrases  government documents  high-level speeches.

Change  incentives

One  those signals  emerged  just  last  weeks. Chinese President Xi Jinping   high-level financial  economic commission meeting  July 1, which called  improving government officials' understanding   their performance  evaluated, according   state media readout. "Routine assessments [ officials] cannot only focus   much GDP  grown   number  major projects,  also   much debt  owed," Xi said  another high-level meeting this month that focused  urban development. The current system  evaluating  performance  government officials  also inadvertently contributed  China' overcapacity issues, where industries  producing more goods than  market  absorb, according  Goldman Sachs. Local authorities  incentivised  collect revenue even  manufacturers  losing money under  current production-based  system, Goldman Sachs Chief China Economist Hui Shan said   report Monday. "Solving overcapacity issues requires  different incentive structure  local officials' evaluation  promotion,"  added. "None  these fundamental adjustments will  easy  quick  implement." As China' economic growth slowed over  last several years, Beijing  emphasized  need  "high-quality" development. But  country still makes   deal    annual GDP target, which  5% this year. Looking ahead, China will likely signal  lower growth target around 4.5%  5%, Guanghua' Liu said. But what' more important   view  that local authorities  then  able  focus more  consumption, rather than investments, which have contributed  overcapacity issues.

Still trying  boost demand

Policymakers will likely also   reduce    urban  rural income —  "common prosperity" — which  increase support  255 million people  help boost consumption, Liu said. But   near term,  economy probably needs  little more stimulus, such   cash transfer,  said. Chinese authorities have stepped  plans  further support employment  improve social welfare. But policymakers have   avoided  mass cash handouts that  U.S.  Hong Kong gave residents  stimulate spending after  pandemic. In  packed month  policymakers, senior party members  also expected  hold  Politburo meeting  discuss  economy      month. But analysts ' have high expectations. With  first half   year   books,  scale  stimulus  pretty much already ,  policymakers   turning their attention   next five years, said Zong Liang, former chief researcher   Bank  China. He expects policymakers  prioritize consumption over investment,  tilt  balance toward  interests  businesses, noting  state  played  larger role   past five years. But  cautioned that Beijing would remain wary   risks that could arise from relaxing  much control. Old habits   hard.

Investors  raving about "neoclouds"  what their emergence means   artificial intelligence boom. However, some warning signs  starting  flash. Neoclouds  companies specializing  AI cloud computing. Unlike traditional hyperscalers such  Amazon  Microsoft, these bespoke companies  viewed  attractive alternatives  they install  manage AI hardware  software   faster  more tailored, cost-effective  potentially more energy-efficient   clients. CoreWeave , which   IPO  late March,   largest publicly traded neocloud. Nebius   --coming name. A swath  private neocloud companies such  Lambda  Crusoe  attracting venture capital funding  working  high-profile AI contracts. Nvidia  taken  interest  these AI-native cloud startups  well. The chipmaking giant  increased  investments  CoreWeave  neocloud startups while also developing   cloud business amid increasing hyperscaler competition. But while analysts like  niche neocloud model  their market share potential   scaling AI cloud market, worries about their longer-term outlook  beginning  crop . Risks they    these companies' high levels  capex spending, lack  differentiation  overall lofty AI valuations. UBS Global Wealth Management strategist Sundeep Gantori views neoclouds   high-risk, potentially high-reward investment. "Last year, [neoclouds] were very small,   ' something that  cannot ignore  terms  size. Obviously,  revenues from those companies     with  capital spending that they' doing," Gantori told CNBC. The problem, however,  these companies  spending  much  capex that  hurts their margins,  said. "They' spending much more,  ' probably  investment into  future," Gantori added. UBS expects AI capex beyond   four tech giants — Amazon , Microsoft , Meta Platforms  Alphabet —  grow 85% year over year   $150 billion  2025. That latter estimate includes robust spending from China, neoclouds  other hyperscalers  enterprise  sovereign cloud providers. Looking  overall market opportunity, Goldman Sachs takes  longer point  view   technology. The firm estimates  total addressable market   GPU---Service  AI cloud market  2030 will  roughly $267 billion — with neoclouds comprising 20% share  hyperscalers 80%. Close ties between Nvidia  neoclouds appear risky Nvidia  strategically backed neoclouds CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe Energy  Nebius —  move that  popularized  space while boosting  chipmaker'  business amid increasing hyperscaler competition. Some analysts question  ultimate cost  this relationship. "Nvidia  helped  rapid growth  several  GPU-focused clouds  directly investing  them, providing them large allocations  GPUs  publicity  various means," HSBC analyst Abhishek Shukla said   Thursday note. "Having  large number  GPU-focused cloud providers improves  competitive position  Nvidia,   margin that  cloud providers  charge declines   bigger share   value  captured  Nvidia   -customer." Shukla  concerned about  couple   financial risks neoclouds face, namely that they already generate  returns from their investments  could  declining pricing power  more GPUs become available. More importantly,  believes neoclouds could lose their business  hyperscaler customers eventually source GPUs directly from Nvidia. For example, Shukla said that CoreWeave  only  business from Microsoft  long  there   shortage  GPUs   long  Nvidia favors CoreWeave while  allocates  GPUs. "Once this phase  over, Microsoft could purchase GPUs directly from Nvidia ...   significant risk   customers Microsoft  Open AI disintermediating CoreWeave  dealing directly with Nvidia,"  said. "We assess that more than 50%  debt financing available  CoreWeave  offered  OEMs (includes Nvidia). In  opinion, Nvidia benefits from this arrangement only  CoreWeave  leasing  GPUs  customers  creating more competition   GPU leasing market, which helps Nvidia," Shukla said. Neoclouds remain  substantial part  Nvidia' longer-term growth opportunity. According  some analysts, Nvidia powering neoclouds, along with   DGX platform  AI development, allows  company  generate revenue from large-scale AI inference workloads   just  GPUs. "NVDA  shifted  strategic posture with regard  Neoclouds materially  last nine months  that they  view them  their -facto data center ," Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah wrote   recent note, adding that "NVDA' "invigorated" Neocloud strategy  dovetailing into  inferencing strategy." Wall Street views   neoclouds Cloud infrastructure companies CoreWeave  Nebius    neocloud players   market right . Europe-based Nebius appears    better-liked play   . The company  four  ratings from Wall Street analysts covering  name, according  LSEG,   recently brought into  limelight   bullish rating from Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval. Duval initiated coverage  Nebius with   rating  12-month price target  $68, which implies 25% upside. "Our rating reflects  more-positive-than-consensus view   growth   AI Neocloud market,   Generative AI market continues  expand rapidly  AI startups/enterprises seek specialized capacity alongside that provided  hyperscalers," Duval said   July 14 note  clients. Duval said Nebius stands  benefit from capital allocation from future funding rounds, more customers  capacity expansion driving revenue  asset utilization,  well  deals with large AI labs  companies improving GPU utilization. "We  Nebius  especially well-positioned  light   full stack software offering, cost advantages  demonstrable expertise  scale,"  said. CoreWeave   largest publicly traded neocloud  market , meanwhile, with  valuation  more than $62 billion. Interest  CoreWeave  still high,   AI stock' frothy valuation  garnered speculation     stock  really . Shares have skyrocketed more than 200% since  company' public market debut   spring. However,  stock  tumbled 30%   past month. CoreWeave' recent slide came after  company announced plans  acquire data center infrastructure company  longtime partner Core Scientific   -stock transition worth roughly $9 billion. The deal could serve   major test   Wall Street views parts   AI glitz  glamour. Worries about  transaction being  stock,  about CoreWeave' -high valuation have been  drag  both stocks. On   that,  consensus price target  $93.71 implies shares could decline nearly 27%, LSEG data shows. CRWV 1Y mountain CoreWeave stock performance over  past year. HSBC' Shukla initiated  stock with  reduce rating  $32 price target, saying CoreWeave shares  significantly overvalued. Shukla noted that CoreWeave' revenue comes primarily from Microsoft  Open AI,   their  software, which  said "dilutes CRWV' value proposition." CoreWeave' liquidity looks stretched , moreover,  company faces  high cost  borrowing,  added. "Compared with  likes  Microsoft, AI model providers have lower liquidity  weaker credit profiles, which creates     challenges," Shukla wrote   note  clients. "CoreWeave' main business  leasing GPUs  getting commoditized  offers inferior returns." Mizuho Securities  Stifel each downgraded CoreWeave  hold earlier this month, while Citigroup  July 8 placed  downside catalyst watch   stock. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino,   early June initiated CoreWeave with  hold rating  12-month target price  $180, shares concerns about  stock' valuation. However, Zino anticipates upside  CoreWeave' bookings   company' customer base broadens  inference demand grows. He likes CoreWeave' revenue backlog, which  said offers multi-year visibility,  estimates CoreWeave will boast  operating profit  2026. "We' very positive  terms   near-term outlook   stock,   just think that there  better, more affordable ways from  valuation perspective  play  overarching theme  compute," Zino told CNBC. "Some neoclouds look good  ,  there  definitely storm clouds that  could potentially    future." The neocloud universe includes  slew  private AI infrastructure startups, including Lambda, Covalent  Crusoe Energy. Crusoe, which uses flare   build data centers,  tapped  Oracle  March  build  data center campus  Texas  Open AI' $500 billion Stargate project, with buildings expected  eventually include 400,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs across  campus.

It'  exactly   trend,  more hedge fund-like strategies continue   launched  ETFs, promising investors returns uncorrelated  traditional stock  bond market indexes.

For investors,    understanding  exact investing style  each (that  vary widely under  general "hedge fund" brand);   differs from traditional stock  bond investments;  much  charges  fees,  whether there  equally good,  cheaper ways,  seek diversification   market over  long-term.

Historically, hedge fund strategies were limited   ultrawealthy  institutional investors  could meet high investment minimums,  that  changed. There   over $5 billion  assets under management  ETFs using some form  hedging  aiming  uncorrelated, diversified returns, according  ETFAction. data.

These products  often classified  alternative absolute return strategies, offering investors  alternative   stock  bond performance tracking   market benchmarks, such   S&P 500 Index  Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index . Hedge fund ETFs  range from event-driven strategies,  multi-strategy portfolios  managed futures funds.

The newest  from  Unlimited lineup  ETFs, founded   former investment committee member   world' biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. It recently launched global macro, long-short  managed futures strategies,  charging 0.95%. While  comparison   made between what these funds  trying     goal   S&P 500 index fund like Vanguard' VOO , investors     more   access  alternative investment strategies. Vanguard' S&P 500 ETF   expense ratio  0.03%.

Mike Akins, CEO  ETF Action, says that these strategies   unique,  useful. "The idea  most  these strategies  ' going   uncorrelated, diversified returns. So,     absolute return strategy that' supposed  perform   market cycles,"  said. "You' creating kind   diversification tool within your overall portfolio,  opportunity  generate solid returns,    uncorrelated fashion  your traditional equity  bond markets,"  added.

Funds that track major market benchmarks such   Russell 1000  S&P 500 should  have very similar performance,  choosing   these ETFs versus another across    ETF managers that offer versions  them ' influence performance much,   . But with managed futures, event-driven  multi-strategy funds, Akins said there    huge divergence  returns across funds  over different time periods.

He said  review   recent performance from this category shows that some  produce negative correlations   broad equity markets,  others purporting  achieve uncorrelated returns have extremely high correlations  major market benchmarks. "All these different strategies, even though they have very similar sounding names,  results    they' going about trying  achieve results  very, very different," Akins said.

That leads Akins  conclude that  most cases, these kinds  ETFs  better left  professional investors  consider. "Generally speaking, they' probably best used   hands   financial professional that understands  they' putting  into  client' portfolio,"  said.

Strategas senior ETF  technical strategist Todd Sohn says that while  fees  higher than many core ETFs, accessing these strategies within  retail fund wrapper   only  most investors  gain access   more sophisticated trades. "Access   ,  then ' also getting what should   uncorrelated strategy  your typical 60/40 stock  bond portfolio,"  said. "It' move   different direction   given . It' help offset, maybe,  losses." He added that while there   guarantees   lead  outperformance versus tradition portfolio structures, "ideally,  acts   little    push  certain environments."

But Akins says that transparency   factor,  these hedge fund-like structures   hard  most investors  understand. "They' running very unique strategies. It really does become more    diligence   manager selection process versus just understanding what' being done  held inside   portfolio like  normal ETF  bond portfolio," Akins said. "The level   diligence that needs   done  much higher  this type  strategy,"  said.

Sohn said  complexities inherent  these funds   factor that investors need  educate themselves  before including   broader portfolio . "There'  little  more nuance  them,  they   long  short, they  play  very different asset classes, like commodities." Sohn said. "So there needs    little    education component,  that complexity  sometimes scare people ,"  said.

Akins said ' fair  consider whether alternatives  take  place  traditional fixed income   diversifier   time when investors  concerned about  bond market' ability  serve   traditional role,    10%  15%   alternative bucket. "But  ' going   that,  really, truly need  understand   reacts,"  said. "Is  truly providing  with uncorrelated returns? Is  making  overall risk  your portfolio decrease? Because  ' , ' paying  ,"  added.

The average expense ratio   alternative ETF space tracked  ETFAction.  92 basis points (0.92%), with some portfolios   below that  others well above 1%, even 2%  some cases, Akins said. "Unless ' truly delivering uncorrelated returns across  market, '  worth  extra money,"  said.

He stressed that this does  mean alternative strategies  like some "Wild West"   ETF market.

"They' defined strategies. They' defined categories. But     about implementing  managed future strategy,      about implementing  multi-strategy portfolio, putting  those different alts ... event-driven, managed futures, global macro [together],     about doing that  very different  everybody,"  said.

Managed futures funds,  example,   over  place  returns year--date, with some ETFs   space   much  3%  others   same category down more than 10%.

"There'  reason those things have been kind  isolated  accredited investors   wealthy," Akins said   history   hedge fund industry.

It   just  complexity   strategies,   fact that they serve  greater role  protecting existing wealth from market downside than growing wealth. For  average investor looking  grow their wealth over  long-term rather than protected  wealth already accumulated, these strategies often   make  much sense, Akins said.

Broad-based bond ETFs  -volatility stock ETFs might  enough  most investors     diversify risk over  long term  portfolios.

"If I'  30-year- looking  invest   markets,  I just want I know ' going   invested   IRA   taxable brokerage account   next 30 years, these   going  provide  benefit,"  said. "For somebody with accumulated wealth,   most important thing   create  portfolio that protects  downside, then that' where these types  strategies really start  play  role   portfolio. But '   YOLO [ only live once] type product,"  said.

Japan' embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba  denied media reports that   considering resigning, according  Reuters.



Local media outlets earlier    said that Ishiba  unsure   future  would take  call  whether  continue  prime minister  August.

Japan' embattled prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, fresh   crushing defeat  upper house elections over  weekend, will     position  strength  negotiate  favorable trade deal with  U.S., analysts said.

The political turmoil leaves Japan vulnerable  trade negotiations with  U.S., advisory firm Quantum Strategy said   note  Monday. ⁠"Trump will show  mercy  [either]  lame duck Ishiba  because   political vacuum,"  firm noted, adding that Japan could   with  25% tariff, come Aug. 1. "Japan     lengthy period  weak governance. That matters  markets because Japan needs  strong government  deal with  defence  trade." Norihiro Yamaguchi, Lead Japan Economist  Oxford Economics, agreed  said that Tokyo    weaker hand  trade talks. With  loss   majority,  government needs  consider opinions from opposition parties more, Yamaguchi told CNBC, pointing  that  U.S. "will probably take this into account  approach negotiations with  strong attitude." He added that  U.S.   prioritize trade talks with Japan   Ishiba' weak mandate, which means that negotiations will likely  protracted.

Indeed, U.S. President Donald Trump  said earlier that    expect   countries  reach  deal. He described Japan  separate occasions  "very tough"  trade talks  labeled  country "spoiled"   accepting U.S. rice despite facing  domestic rice shortage. Japan  imported just over 350,000 tons  rice  2024 from  U.S., with  U.S. being  largest exporter  rice  Japan  that year. The sticking points  also adding . Before  upper house elections, Japan'  negotiator Ryosei Akazawa  brushed aside  deadlines, including  U.S.′ August 1 deadline, adding that  would  sacrifice Japan' agriculture sector   sake   early agreement. He also reportedly said that  deal must include auto concessions   country, which   cornerstone  Japan' economy. While Quantum Strategy  bleak   outlook  Japan, saying that "Trump' draconian tariffs will cripple  economy," analysts from HSBC have taken  different view. With  upper house election over, Ishiba   more room  compromise with  U.S.,  HSBC analysts said, which could raise hopes   deal. This could    form  increasing imports from  U.S., such  LNG, defense equipment,  agricultural goods,  relaxing -tariff barriers,  return  some form  U.S. tariff relief. "For Prime Minister Ishiba,  favourable U.S. trade deal could help stave   -confidence motion  internal challenge from  LDP, "  HSBC analysts said Monday.



But Oxford' Yamaguchi cautioned against raising hopes  early, especially regarding  removal  reciprocal tariffs. "The precedents    U.K., Vietnam,  other countries have shown that even  negotiations proceed smoothly,  will  difficult  completely withdraw reciprocal tariffs,"  pointed .

'A rock   hard place'

Japan  also have overplayed  hand  trade negotiations with  U.S., Alex Capri, senior lecturer   Business School   National University  Singapore, told CNBC. "Japan misgauged  Trump administration' lack  appreciation  Tokyo' increasing role   anchor  U.S strategic interests  Asia," Capri said Tokyo  strengthened defense ties with  U.S. under  late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe   successors,   also focused  supply chain resilience   counterbalance  China. "Japanese negotiators, therefore, believed that Tokyo would  rewarded   role   stalwart security partner when  came   recent trade talks. It didn' happen,"  also added.

He thinks that Japanese negotiators failed  account  Trump' reality TV-style  communication, which  more geared   social media audience. This resulted  public comments about  negotiations — which should have remained private — stoking  "increasingly confrontational public back--forth"  fueling reluctance  both sides  shift their positions. Japan'  negotiator, Akazawa,  failed  deliver  breakthroughs despite making eight trips   U.S.. However, Stephen Olson, visiting senior fellow  Singapore' ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that Japan  caught between " rock   hard place." While Japan could  offer substantial concessions  agriculture  autos —    most politically sensitive areas — without suffering domestic blowback, there  also  need  Tokyo  keep  wider strategic relationship with  U.S.  solid ground, Olson said. "Based  past experience, Japan would [also]  justified  wondering  Trump would actually honor  trade deal  might have signed with Japan. In this case, I ' think Japan misread  U.S. - I think  read  U.S. quite clearly,"  said Olson also noted there  still time  negotiations,  like before,  tariff deadline might  pushed back.

A recent flurry  announcements from major automakers  incumbent cell producers appears  have renewed optimism. Solid-state batteries  thought  offer significantly higher energy density than conventional lithium- batteries, fueling expectations that they could enable  next-generation  EVs.

"Many   players announcing movement   space  targeting 2027/28  commercial production,  many cases initially  semi-solid rather than full solid state," Iola Hughes, head  research  Rho Motion, told CNBC  email. "Semi-solid batteries offer improved energy density  safety over conventional lithium- cells   easier  manufacture, making them  practical bridge toward solid-state technology," Hughes said. "However, they ' match  full performance potential  true solid-state batteries  terms  energy density, compactness,  long-term scalability,"  added. What  solid-state batteries? Solid-state batteries contain  solid electrolyte, made from materials such  ceramics,  opposed  conventional lithium- batteries, which contain liquid electrolyte.

Since  start   year, President Donald Trump' unpredictable tariff announcements have been roiling businesses   sizes. The European Union  particular  drawn Trump'    198 billion euro ($231 billion) trade surplus  goods with  U.S. He argues tariffs  needed  create  more balanced relationship; EU officials, however, argue that trade  more even across goods, services  investments,  have pledged  increase    purchases  narrow  . Last weekend, Trump announced   planning    EU with  blanket tariff rate  30% from Aug. 1, after last-minute negotiations failed  produce  framework deal. Huge uncertainty  hangs over whether  agreement   struck   next  weeks,  what details  compromises  might contain.

'It will   lose-lose situation'

The Trump administration  already imposed  10% baseline duty  EU imports, along with higher rates  automotives  metals. The fact that  U.K.' trade deal with  U.S. maintained  10% baseline tariff with some sector exemptions   many  believe that this could  Europe' best hope.

"In terms  pricing, 30% [tariffs] would  untenable. The whole situation definitely stifles your ambition stateside,"  added. For Franck Choisne, president  French distillery Combier,  10% tariff  been just about manageable.

However, Choisne notes that  10% tariff comes      from  currency market. A weaker U.S. dollar this year  made  more expensive   U.S.  import foreign goods,  additional dampener  demand. A 30% tariff, plus exchange rate effects, would mean  overall rate  45-50%  reflected  final consumer prices,  said,  level that could halve  company' U.S. sales.

The British government    give 1.5 million 16  17-year-olds  vote, unlocking   voter base  competing political parties. Social media could    their success.

The government  Thursday said that  plans  bring forward  elections bill which will grant 16  17-year-olds  right  vote   U.K. elections.

It marks  biggest change  Britain' electorate since  voting   reduced from 21  1969.

If approved  parliament,  would   major overhaul   country' democratic system. The proposal, which  included  last year' Labour manifesto, will bring national elections  line with Scotland  Wales,  government said.

The latest changes mean British political parties  face  challenge  engaging younger voters   social media .

More teenagers  shunning traditional media outlets  getting their news from social media, according   2024 report from Ofcom.

Online sources continue   most popular among  younger  groups, with 88%  16-24-year-olds using online sources  such updates. Social media   main driver  this, with 82%  young adults using this platform,  only half  16-24 year-olds using TV  news.

In  12-15-year- category, 12%  teens cited TikTok  their main source  news.

"TikTok certainly   ,    most popular digital content platform  young people. Whilst  platform' success lasts forever,   hard    changes   wider trend  more  more   public getting  news content from these apps  general," said Steven Buckley, lecturer  digital media sociology  City University  London.

Buckley stressed that  content politicians post  paramount, however,  that desperate attempt   "down with  kids" ' work.

"One   core currencies  today' society  authenticity. Trying   over 16  17 year olds  simply posting  bunch  TikToks  saying that  leader   opposition  "Skibiddi Ohio Rizz"   going   them over. They will simply  labelled 'cringe'   dismissed,"  told CNBC.

"The perception that young people  disinterested  politics  their communities  simply  true. They care deeply about inequality,  environment  social justice. Politicians wanting   over these  voters     actually addressing their material concerns."

Social media  become pivotal  winning elections. Former U.S. President Barack Obama'   Facebook broke  ground  2008, while current White House leader Trump' tweets helped rally  voter base during both  2016 presidential campaign  -election  2024.

Although political information  become more readily available across multiple platforms,  hasn' necessarily translated into higher turnout  polls. Turnout  59.7% during  2024 U.K. general election,  lowest since 2001, according   parliamentary report.

The jury  still   whether giving younger people  right  vote will make  sizeable impact. A poll  16  17-year-olds  political consultancy Merlin Strategy showed that    500 surveyed, only 18% said they would definitely vote   election took place tomorrow

Scarlett Maguire, founder  Merlin Strategy, said political parties will have  develop   more technology  media strategies.

"Politicians need   more than just give  vote  appeal  engage young people. At  moment, this  group   very engaged with politics  politicians,  politicians will need   quite    appeal  them,"  said.

The Labour Party  widely seen  have  most  gain from lowering  voting . However, Nigel Farage' right-wing Reform UK party could also  significant backing from this  group, according  Maguire. Farage   times  many followers  TikTok than Labour does.

"Reform probably   best digital media  social media campaign strategies  last election. Reform  doing well with this  group, particularly male teenagers. Now  will  whether  other parties, especially  Conservatives   polling very  with this  group,  catch ," Maguire added.

Among  other plans     government   accept bank cards  voter ID  polling stations   time   next general election, which  currently slated  2029.

There  several short-term reasons  this carnage  plenty  long-term ones. The most important   former   rise  employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs),  payroll , introduced  Chancellor Rachel Reeves  April this year. However, more damaging than  increase   rate — which rose from 13.8%  15% —   drop   threshold  which   paid from £9,100  £5,000.

Among them  Bob Wigley, -owner  Margot,  popular restaurant  London' Covent Garden recently forced  close.

The British Retail Consortium,  main industry body,  estimated that  hike  employers' NICs will cost  retail sector alone some £2.3 billion.

Local councils have also pushed  parking charges  introduced -called " traffic neighborhoods," making high-street shopping tricky  those  rely  their cars, prompting many bigger operators — likes  Next  Marks & Spencer —  shift  --town retail parks. But there  also longer-term factors. Business rates —   dating back 400 years levied   "rateable value"  most -domestic properties such  shops, offices, pubs  warehouses —  bricks--mortar retailers much harder than online retailers like Amazon, which  also blamed  sucking business away from  high street.

The government says  business rates system  designed  "protect  high street"  support investment. Regardless,  acceleration  store closures  raised fears that this   structural downturn, rather than just cyclical. There  some evidence  this. In  past, when  established retailer  forced   business, other operators stepped   take  place.

However, more recently when  store  closed,   remained closed, which, added   exodus  retail parks,  left many high streets with  sense  decay. When   retail destination closes  moves , footfall  reduced. Accordingly,  typical British high street, which   1980s  1990s boasted familiar names like Boots, Woolworths  Marks & Spencer,  more likely these days   home  vape shops, American-style candy stores, tattoo parlors  charity shops ( latter  which benefit from significantly lower business rates). The sense that this   structural change also reflects  shift  retail property ownership.

The typical high street landlord  more likely these days    "  " operator unable  offer tenants better terms when they  into difficulty. All  this sounds like  perfect storm,  there  another, less frequently acknowledged factor  play: going into  21st century, when Amazon began eating  lunch    bricks--mortar retailers, there were simply  many players. Many retailers will  countenance  idea,  perhaps what  have seen over  last quarter century  simply over-capacity being taken    market. — Ian King

For well over  decade, Grace Hamilton, 27, experienced hair loss, heavy periods, infrequent menstrual cycles, mental health issues  difficulty losing weight without knowing . It wasn' until 2023 when   diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome,  PCOS,  hormonal disorder common among women  reproductive . After   limited improvements from birth control, diet  exercise, Hamilton joined  trial  2024 examining  GLP-1 drug  PCOS patients. By October,  received  first weekly dose  semaglutide,  active ingredient  Novo Nordisk ' obesity injection Wegovy  diabetes shot Ozempic. She said some results were almost immediate: after months without  cycle,  period resumed within  weeks  starting  drug. After 10 months   treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds,  hair regrowth  reported significant improvements  depression  anxiety "I'  glad that I stuck with  because   just clear   that    missing link  ," said Hamilton,  works   nonprofit  Arvada, Colorado, adding that  maintained diet  exercise while   drug. She  just   several women  have reported improvements  symptoms  PCOS after using GLP-1s,  growing class  obesity  diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand  investor buzz over  last  years. Treating PCOS  among several   unapproved potential uses   blockbuster drugs beyond promoting weight loss  regulating blood sugar.

PCOS, which  frequently underdiagnosed, affects  estimated 5 million  6 million women  reproductive    U.S., according  some estimates. The condition  typically characterized  higher levels  testosterone  other hormones usually associated with  called androgens, which  leads  symptoms such  irregular  painful periods, excess hair growth  acne. PCOS   most common cause  infertility. The condition  strongly linked  metabolic issues,   estimated 35%  80%  patients experience insulin resistance. That means  pancreas pumps  more insulin  keep blood sugar  check,  high insulin levels  promote weight gain  disrupt hormone balance. A significant share  women with PCOS have obesity  Type 2 diabetes. Yet there'  standard PCOS treatment. Current options like birth control, lifestyle changes   diabetes drug Metformin  only help with certain symptoms, which could differ depending   patient. But some health experts  promise  GLP-1s, particularly given their effect  improving weight loss  insulin sensitivity. "The unmet need  massive," said Dr. Melanie Cree,  pediatric endocrinologist  Children' Hospital Colorado. "Primary therapies used  PCOS symptoms haven' changed  nearly 50 years." Cree,   also  professor   University  Colorado School  Medicine,  been studying  effect  GLP-1s  adolescents with PCOS  more than 10 years. She previously studied  oral form  semaglutide    ongoing clinical trial   injectable version, which  what Hamilton participated   10 months. But  studies  still small  comparison  drugmakers' previous clinical trials  GLP-1s with thousands  patients. Not    women  have   completed Cree' ongoing study lost significant weight, demonstrating that  everyone  respond  GLP-1s. Novo Nordisk  rival Eli Lilly have been studying their GLP-1s  potential treatments  other chronic conditions like fatty liver disease,   PCOS. Cree said that' because  Food  Drug Administration   established specific "endpoints"  goals drugs must meet  clinical trials  demonstrate  effective they   PCOS. In  statement,  Novo Nordisk spokesperson said  company welcomes "independent research investigating  safety, efficacy  clinical utility   products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly   immediately respond   request  comment. Conducting longer  larger trials  better understand  effect  GLP-1s  PCOS symptoms  crucial, said Sasha Ottey, executive director   advocacy group PCOS Challenge. It  still unclear  GLP-1s  help address  resolve  PCOS symptoms,  whether  effect differs depending   patient'    specific drug, Ottey said. She added that certain patients   lose weight  GLP-1s,  others   need  shed pounds. Meanwhile, insurance coverage  GLP-1s   barrier  some PCOS patients,   often eligible  approved uses   drugs. Most plans cover GLP-1s  diabetes,    obesity  unapproved uses. The drugs  cost roughly $1,000  month before insurance. Still, Eli Lilly  Novo Nordisk offer significant discounts  their drugs  some patients     --pocket.

Why GLP-1s  address PCOS symptoms

More research  needed  fully understand  GLP-1s  help some PCOS patients,  Cree said their effect  symptoms appears   largely indirect. She said   finding  several previous studies motivated   start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing  little  5%  body weight  improve insulin sensitivity. That makes  body respond better  insulin,   doesn' need  produce  much    manage blood sugar. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree  some researchers believe causes  ovaries  produce less testosterone ,   result,  help reduce symptoms such  irregular periods, acne  excess hair growth. "One   questions , what other methods   have  improve insulin sensitivity?" Cree said. She noted that other recommended treatments  PCOS symptoms, such  food changes, increasing exercise   diabetes drug Metformin,  based  that goal. GLP-1s such  semaglutide improve insulin sensitivity  reduce appetite through several mechanisms. That includes slowing  quickly food leaves  stomach, prompting  pancreas  release insulin when blood sugar  high  suppressing  release   hormone that raises blood sugar. The weight loss caused  GLP-1s further helps improve insulin sensitivity.

Early results from Cree' ongoing study support  idea that GLP-1s  lower testosterone. The trial, which began  2023, follows girls  women ages 12  35 with obesity  PCOS      Metformin. The study  designed  administer semaglutide  patients  10 months,  examine their weight loss, metabolic changes  improvements  reproductive function. Cree hopes  trial will answer whether GLP-1s  improve ovulation  women with PCOS. Many women with PCOS ' ovulate regularly, which  lead  irregular periods  difficulty getting pregnant. Cree  initial data  11 women  completed  10 months  semaglutide  were   Metformin. She said eight  them lost more than 10%  their body weight    reduction  their testosterone levels. Five    eight patients  their testosterone levels reach "normal ranges," Cree said. Meanwhile,     eight patients reported more regular periods. Cree said  trial will eventually have data from 40 women,    still enrolling patients   group that takes Metformin. She said  will likely take  years before  publishes  first results from  study, which will focus   differences  outcomes between kids  adults  only received semaglutide. She said comparing  groups  crucial because hormones that control growth  released during puberty, which could change  kids respond  GLP-1s. Not  women with PCOS will benefit from taking  GLP-1. Cree said   trial, three patients  completed 10 months  semaglutide   lose  least 10%  their body weight. One  those women   lose weight  ,  said. Cree said that' consistent with previous studies  GLP-1s  adults with obesity. Despite  promise  GLP-1s  improving symptoms, more research  also needed  PCOS itself, said Dr. Karen Tang,  OB-GYN  founder  Thrive Gynecology. She said some people  experience hallmark symptoms   condition, such  facial hair  acne, even though they have normal levels  testosterone. "There' still   that' very much unknown about PCOS  exactly   disease kind  works," Tang told CNBC.

GLP-1s give some patients   boost

Anecdotal evidence suggests GLP-1s  address more than just weight issues  people with PCOS. In  recent survey  1,700 people   birth control  Natural Cycles, 64%  women with PCOS  took  GLP-1 reported more predictable periods,  20% said their bleeding days were shorter. Some patients with PCOS  also lose more weight  GLP-1s than those without  condition, said Dr. Kerry Krauss,  OB/GYN  medical director  Natural Cycles,   PCOS herself. Research needs  confirm those benefits,   said  gives hope  many PCOS patients   frustrated with common treatments   condition. Those options typically target just  aspect  PCOS, such  reducing androgen levels with certain types  birth control. Tang added that diet  exercise alone often fall short  addressing symptoms: "A   people  exercise very aggressively  regularly  watch what they   still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight,  blood sugar."

That   case  Haley Sipes,  31-year- mother  three based  Western Kentucky  experienced PCOS symptoms  years without  diagnosis. In 2022, before being diagnosed,  lost 75 pounds over 10 months through diet  exercise alone. Her progress stalled  late 2022 despite  intense diet  exercise regimen,   weight began  fluctuate  2023. By -2024,   regained about 30 pounds. Sipes sought help from  primary care provider  underwent blood work, which revealed    hormonal imbalance. Initial efforts  regulate  hormones with progesterone  testosterone   limited effect. Further bloodwork diagnosed Sipes with PCOS  insulin resistance, which  views   root cause   weight loss struggles. She recalled bloating, fatigue,  energy,  water retention during earlier efforts  lose weight. Despite  history  painful, irregular periods  ovarian cysts since  10,  providers never mentioned PCOS   possible diagnosis. In September 2024,  doctor prescribed Zepbound. Her insurance covered     BMI  prediabetes status. Sipes said  noticed changes within  first month:  food cravings quieted,  inflammation decreased,  experienced less joint pain,   period became less painful  occurred more regularly. Sipes added that     ovarian cysts since starting Zepbound. After around eight months   medication,  lost more than 60 pounds. Sipes said those results significantly improved  emotional health. "All  symptoms  being overweight might  seem like  things,  when  have 20 little things that  constantly nagging , then ' going      mood sometimes," Sipes said. "I' just  better version  myself when I'  controlled  food thoughts  hormonal issues that cause mood swings,"  continued. "My life does feel  much more enjoyable." Sipes plans  continue taking Zepbound  maintain  results, possibly  lower doses. She noted that more research  needed  whether PCOS symptoms  fully resolve.

Insurance coverage   challenge

Insurance coverage  currently  biggest hurdle preventing PCOS patients from accessing GLP-1s, said Dr. Alyssa Dominguez,  endocrinologist with Keck School  Medicine   University  Southern California. She said many PCOS patients  eligible   GLP-1s  their approved uses based  BMI  related conditions,    have coverage. More than -third  employers  cover GLP-1s  both weight loss  diabetes, while 55% only cover them  diabetes, according   recent survey from  International Foundation  Employee Benefit Plans.

The China-U.S. trade    first Donald Trump administration  Apple CEO Tim Cook    charm offensive with  president while maintaining strong relations with Beijing. Apple avoided U.S. tariffs  continued  grow  China, while Cook earned  reputation   skilled policy navigator  prominent American business envoy  Beijing. But,  Trump 2.0,  only  Apple lost  crown  Nvidia  America' most valuable company, several tech pundits   AI darling' charismatic leader, Jensen Huang,  left Cook  behind  political influence. "Huang  become  global figure  taken    role politically    success   AI revolution," said Wedbush' Dan Ives, adding that  importance  Nvidia' AI chips  "vaulted  ahead  Cook." "He  found himself   very strong position  navigate  political landscape ... [] there  only  chip   world fueling  AI revolution,  that' Nvidia'," Ives said. The optics  Huang' political ascendancy have never been stronger,  Nvidia last week announced during  CEO' latest visit  Beijing that  expected  soon resume sales   H20 AI chips  China.

Huang' 'historic' week

The exports   H20 chip  China  been restricted earlier this year —  move that Huang openly lobbied against. "It   historic   Nvidia  Jensen ...  I think  shows  increasing political influence that Huang' having within  Trump administration," Ives said. Huang   with Trump  DC right before  China visit. The H20 reversal  been linked  trade negotiations between  U.S.  China. However, several experts told CNBC that Huang' lobbying played  large role  . The Nvidia CEO   with Trump many times this year, including joining    trip   Middle East  May, which resulted   massive AI deal that will   delivery  hundreds  thousands  Nvidia' advanced AI chips   United Arab Emirates. The Emirates deal  been seen     America  push  global tech leadership, solidifying  technology stack    market over potential rivals like China' Huawei. After  trip, Huang increasingly began making  case against U.S. chip restrictions, arguing that they would erode America' tech leadership   benefit  domestic Chinese players. According   report from  New York Times, this  also been  narrative Huang  been pushing  Trump   officials behind  scenes. Paul Triolo, senior vice president  China  technology policy lead  DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told CNBC that Huang' arguments aligned with  thinking  influential White House AI  Crypto Czar David Sacks, further swaying  administration  lift restrictions  H20 chip exports. "Sacks  Huang both argue that limiting exports  U.S. technology such  select  -cutting-edge GPUs  China risks pushing Chinese companies   domestic alternatives ... At     , this argument likely carried     H20 issue,"  said. It' unclear when   Nvidia will restart production lines   H20,   Nvidia  simply able  sell existing stocks   chips,  will still   "significant revenue boost  beneficial  Nvidia  terms  retaining clients' goodwill  China," Triolo added. Nvidia said  took  $4.5 billion writedown   unsold H20 inventory  May. Huang said last week that every civil AI model should    U.S. technology stack, "encouraging nations worldwide  choose America,"  Nvidia announced resuming H20 sales soon.

Not Musk,  Cook

When Trump   second presidential election  November, many  expected  different tech CEO  hold  most influence   administration      bridge between  U.S.  China. But Tesla' Elon Musk   rather public break- with Trump. In November, experts told CNBC that Musk' close ties  Trump   business interests  China could help soften  president' aggressive trade stance toward Beijing, while cautioning against putting  much stock into  Tesla CEO. Meanwhile, under Trump' second presidency, Apple' Cook  seen some strong pushback from  administration. In May, Trump expressed  "little problem with Tim Cook" over Apple manufacturing products  India, despite  iPhone maker' commitment   $500 billion investment   U.S., announced  February. In response   latest trade tensions between China   U.S., Apple  accelerated efforts  -risk supply chains from China  moving more iPhone production  India. Earlier this month, Trump adviser Peter Navarro also criticized Cook, saying    moving production   China fast enough. Apple  Cook were seen   most influential company  CEO, respectively,   first Trump administration,    Huang  Nvidia, said Ray Wang, CEO  Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research. "Almost everything rides  Nvidia' chips."

As semiconductors have become  geopolitical  potato over  past  years, '  surprise that Nvidia ,  leader  artificial intelligence-related chips,  been caught   escalating tensions between  U.S.  China. When Nvidia returned   China market last week , seemingly with  blessing  Washington,  sparked debate over  strategic implications   U.S.' dominance  AI  China'  focus  boosting  domestic chip  tech industry. For  U.S., Nvidia' return could help cement American strength  AI globally, experts told CNBC. For China,  could   country time   continues    path  build Nvidia rivals  keep pace with AI software development. It'  tricky relationship, underscoring  strategic importance   graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia designs  that currently underpin  world' AI. "The relationship  symbiotic  I  believe China needs  U.S. technology more  this moment  time," Daniel Newman, CEO  Futurum, told CNBC' "The China Connection" last week. Nvidia' warnings Earlier this year,  U.S. government restricted exports  Nvidia' H20 chip  China. The product,  less-advanced version  Nvidia' leading hardware,  been created  comply with previous U.S. export restrictions. Washington  expressed concerned that these chips could  used  areas such  advancing  Chinese military  China'  AI industry. Nvidia took  $4.5 billion writedown   unsold inventory  warned  China restrictions could impact billions  dollars  potential sales. Jensen Huang,  CEO  Nvidia,  been critical  export curbs . He  said  would   "tremendous loss"  Nvidia   participate  China  that rival Huawei would  able  fulfil  needs   country   absence. Huang  argued that  restrictions could boost China' domestic semiconductor industry  that  risks eroding America' technological edge. That message appears  have  through   White House. Nvidia said last week that  received backing from  U.S. government  resume sales  H20  China. How  move will benefit  U.S. From  business perspective, Nvidia  expected  gain. But  Washington,  move  more strategic. "We want  keep having  Chinese   American technology stack, because they still rely upon ," Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last week. Nvidia  managed  gain  formidable position   market  semiconductors required  train   AI applications,  just because   hardware  also because   popularity   software platform known  CUDA, that developers build . This creates  "ecosystem" around Nvidia' products which  proven sticky   users. The return   H20   world' second-largest economy will " China time"  boost  domestic industry, according  Pranay Kotasthane, deputy director   Takshashila Institution. "But  will also   U.S. companies some respite. China  Nvidia' largest market   home  50  cent  AI developers according  Jensen Huang. If that path  completely closed, American firms like Nvidia will find  difficult  raise revenues  -invest them   next round  research  development," Kotasthane said. "It might  justifiable  restrain access   most advanced chips   expand  scope   restrictions doesn' make strategic sense." China domestic chips  focus Huawei  been China' leading player  developing AI-focused chips. The country' technology companies  using some  Huawei' hardware   firm    overtake  dominance  Nvidia' latest chips. One possible outcome  that U.S. export curbs will accelerate China' domestic efforts. China  been looking  boost  domestic semiconductor industry with  particular focus  AI chips. There   whole host  startups working   products   country. Nvidia' return  China could slowdown that progress. "If Nvidia' chips  made available  Chinese firms,  could weaken momentum behind domestic chip projects,   capital,  delay progress  domestic Chinese hardware. This retains U.S. tech influence over global AI rails," Tejas Dessai, director  research  Global X ETFs, told CNBC  email. Ultimately,   goes back  Nvidia' software which keeps developers locked into  hardware. "Chinese model developers still prefer   Nvidia hardware, because  domestic alternative AI stack, particularly  software development environment from Huawei  still difficult    lacks  depth  flexibility  Nvidia' offering," Paul Triolo,  partner  DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told CNBC  email. Can China catch   Nvidia? Still, China' direction  travel   quest  domestic providers  AI chips  unlikely  change. "Eventually Chinese AI model developers will have  transitions   domestic AI stack," Triolo said. Nvidia' chips have proved very effective  training huge AI models that require massive amounts  data   processed. The actual running  those AI model  products like chatbots  known  inferencing. This process  require  different type  chip, which Chinese tech giants  well  startups  working . "In chips, China' opportunity could come when  focus shifts  inference. That' when demand  lower cost, efficient processors could scale,   believe custom chip programs from  Chinese tech companies could ultimately serve that demand," Dessai  Global X ETFs said.

A universal cancer vaccine – what once seemed like  pipe dream –   inching closer  becoming reality.

On Friday, University  Florida researchers said findings from   study could lead   development   universal shot that  jumpstart  immune system  fight cancer. The study  mice, published  Nature Biomedical Engineering, showed that  experimental mRNA vaccine boosted  tumor-fighting effects   common cancer drug called immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The vaccine   designed   specific virus  cancer cells,  engineered  "wake "  immune system against  disease, "spurring   respond   fighting  virus," according   UF release.

"What  found   using  vaccine designed   target cancer specifically  rather  stimulate  strong immunologic response,  could elicit  very strong anticancer reaction," Dr. Duane Mitchell,  -author   study  professor  neurosurgery   university' College  Medicine, said   release.

That' unlike current approaches  cancer vaccines, which involve finding  target expressed  many cancer patients ,   case  Moderna  Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored  each patient' specific tumor.

The universal vaccine   potential   used broadly across cancer patients, "even possibly leading    --shelf cancer vaccine," Mitchell said.

The UF researchers  still working  replicate  findings  humans. If they ,  -size-fits- vaccine could provide  alternative  surgery, radiation  chemotherapy.

Here'   vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells  body  produce certain proteins that stimulate  immune system, including  called PD-L1, which  often found   surface  inside  cancer cells. Those cells often  PD-L1  hide from immune attacks.

But  boosting PD-L1,  vaccine  actually make tumors more vulnerable  immune checkpoint inhibitors that block that protein, helping  immune system recognize  destroy  cancer.

The study showed promising results  treatment-resistant tumors  skin cancers  combining  mRNA vaccine with  monoclonal antibody,  common immunotherapy drug that attempts  alert  immune system that  tumor  foreign  should  attacked.

It also showed positive results when tested  mouse skin, bone  brain cancers   solo treatment. In some cases,  tumors were eliminated entirely.

"This paper describes  very unexpected  exciting observation: that even  vaccine  specific   particular tumor  virus –  long     mRNA vaccine – could lead  tumor-specific effects," said senior author Dr. Elias Sayour,  UF Health pediatric oncologist,   release.

People with  disease eventually lose  ability  walk,  most   their early 20s, meaning there'  huge unmet need  treatment. The FDA  2023 originally granted Elevidys  conditional approval  patients only between  ages  4  5,  group that   most benefit  clinical trials.

The following year,  agency granted  treatment full approval  patients 4  older  could still walk  accelerated approval  patients 4    could  longer walk. The latter decision  especially contentious because there  less evidence that Elevidys could help people whose disease  already progressed  much.

Plus, Elevidys failed  meet  goal   Phase 3 trial, though  company contended that  drug showed promise  other metrics   study. Then head   FDA' Center  Biologics Evaluation  Research, Peter Marks, agreed with Sarepta' assessment  overruled FDA staff  expand approval  Elevidys.

Earlier this year, Sarepta disclosed that  teenage boys died from liver failure after receiving Elevidys. Then this week, reports emerged that another person died during  Phase 1 trial investigating another   Sarepta' gene therapies   different disease.

The  therapies  different, though they share  same method  delivery, heightening  safety concerns around Elevidys. The safety risks  Elevidys  especially important given  uncertain benefit, said BMO analyst Kostas Biliouris.

For example, Novartis' gene therapy Zolgensma  spinal muscular atrophy  also caused liver toxicity  death,   benefit  that treatment  clear.

"That'  deaths here matter  much versus Zolgensma,  example," Biliouris said.

And Zolgensma  just  drug  many   large company like Novartis. For Sarepta, Elevidys  everything.

Executives this week tried  reassure investors that even    only treat patients   still walk, where deaths haven' been reported,  therapy should bring   least $500 million  year. Sarepta last month stopped shipping Elevidys  patients    longer walk while  explores  safer   administer  treatment.

The  concern  investors  this point  whether  FDA pulls  drug, Biliouris said. The company' stock   fallen more than 87% this year.

"If  FDA pulls Elevidys from  market,"  says, "Sarepta  done."

Lowering drug prices    goal   Trump administration, which  facing  tough balancing    threatens  impose   200% tariffs  pharmaceuticals imported into  U.S.     reshore drug manufacturing.

The FDA  June announced  national priority voucher plan that aims   drug review times  -- months  companies  says  supporting "U.S. national interests." But previous announcements   voucher program   explicitly mention making drugs more affordable   criterion.

The Food  Drug Administration will consider drug affordability when granting companies  vouchers that speed  approvals  some treatments,  agency' Commissioner Marty Makary told CNBC  Friday.

Commissioner   Food  Drugs Administration Marty Makary speaks   news conference  removing synthetic dyes from America' food supply,   Health  Human Services Headquarters  Washington, DC  April 22, 2025.

Makary added that President Donald Trump  "very adamant that  would lower drug prices  Americans,   doesn' like  that Americans  getting ripped  with drugs that  , five, 10 times higher"   U.S. compared  other developed countries.

But   unclear   Trump administration will consider affordability when reviewing  drug,  prices   product' launch  usually determined after  approval   U.S.

The FDA' website currently outlines four examples  "national priorities" that will  used  determine which companies will   voucher under   program. That includes addressing  health crisis   U.S., delivering "more innovative cures"  Americans, addressing unmet public health needs  "increasing domestic drug manufacturing   national security issue."

Drug affordability  have been included previously, according   Wall Street Journal report  June.

A spokesperson   Department  Health  Human Services confirmed that  FDA will consider drug affordability   program, adding  criteria aren' limited  earlier examples.

When asked  provide examples   health crisis that companies  meet with their drugs, Makary said  wants    cure  Type 1 diabetes, more treatments  neurodegenerative diseases   universal  shot "  ' have    guess which strain  coming."

He also said  wants   more treatments  stage 4 cancer,  when  disease  spread from  original site  distant parts   body.

"We have  committee that'   that will determine which products  companies will  these vouchers  part   pilot," Makary said. "But '     things. We'    ourselves,  does  take  long  come  market? And  want   more cures  meaningful treatments  Americans."

The FDA will give   vouchers this year. After  -year pilot phase,  agency  increase  number  quick approvals  gives  companies.

Some Wall Street analysts have previously said  voucher program could  more effective than tariffs  encouraging drugmakers  bring their manufacturing   U.S.

But questions remain about  risks  speeding  drug reviews   little  30 days, which   fastest  FDA  ever done.

Another potential concern  whether  FDA will offer vouchers  political allies   Trump administration, which could include companies that agency staff would normally scrutinize.

President Donald Trump  Tuesday threatened  impose   200% tariffs  pharmaceuticals imported into  U.S. "very soon."

"They' going   tariffs  very high rate, like 200%," Trump said during  Cabinet meeting.

But  suggested that those levies would   into effect immediately, saying  will "give people about  year, year   half."

"We' give them  certain period  time   their  together," Trump said, apparently referring  drugmakers bringing back manufacturing into  U.S.

"The industry shares President Trump' goal  revitalizing American manufacturing   recently announced hundreds  billions  dollars  U.S. investment,  placing tariffs  medicines would  counterproductive  these efforts,"  continued.

A version  this article first appeared  CNBC' Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings  latest health-care news straight  your inbox. Subscribe here  receive future editions. A revamped government panel  vaccine advisors with newly appointed immunization skeptics  voted against  mercury-containing shot ingredient that  anti-vaccine movement  long targeted. The group, called  Advisory Committee  Immunization Practices,  ACIP, voted Thursday  recommend annual single-dose  vaccines  Americans  against influenza shots containing thimerosal – even though there   evidence  harm from that preservative. It   first ACIP meeting since Health  Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gutted  panel  stacked  with  members, including several well-known vaccine skeptics. The Centers  Disease Control  Prevention still needs  sign   that recommendation. If  agency does,  would affect roughly 4%  5%   U.S.  vaccine supply. The rest   nation'  shots were thimerosal-free during  last season   virus, according  CDC data. But when  comes  vaccinating  entire country, "small percentages matter," Dr. Sean O'Leary,  infectious disease expert with  American Academy  Pediatrics, told reporters last week. If   thimerosal-containing  shots were removed from  market, "that would inevitably lead  fewer people being vaccinated,  least   short term, perhaps longer term,  subsequently more hospitalizations  deaths," O'Leary said. The recommendation also reinforces longstanding, unfounded fears that  substance  lead  developmental disabilities, such  autism. Kennedy' vaccine skepticism comes full circle with  panel' vote: A decade before stepping into  current role,  published  book that called   removal  thimerosal from shots  linked   developmental disorders. "A very common anti-vaccine talking point  around thimerosal,  that'  very clear strategy   distrust  vaccines," O'Leary said.

"The thought , well, mercury   scary sounding word,  ' just   , ' just make this  -issue," O'Learly said. He added that "many studies have shown that   entirely safe,   associated with  neurodevelopmental disorders   other adverse effects." Some multi-dose forms   vaccines  adults still contain thimerosal, including Sanofi' Fluzone   shots from biotech company CSL Seqirus. One member   panel, Dr. Cody Meissner,  professor  pediatrics   Dartmouth Geisel School  Medicine, said   worried that discouraging    multidose vials could increase  cost  vaccination  limit access  some groups. He also expressed concerns about  message  recommendation would send  other countries where    multi-dose  vaccines  more common. "That might limit  availability   influenza vaccine  some people,"  said during  meeting after  voted against restricting thimerosal  vaccines.

President Donald Trump' " beautiful bill" would make sweeping changes  U.S. health care, leaving millions  vulnerable Americans without health insurance  threatening  hospitals  centers that provide care  them. The Senate  Tuesday voted 51-50  pass  spending measure after  marathon overnight voting session  amendments. But  bill will face another major test   House, where Republicans have  razor-thin majority  some members have already raised objections   legislation. Recent changes   bill would  roughly $1.1 trillion  health-care spending over  next decade, according   estimates from  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. More than $1 trillion  those cuts would come from Medicaid,  joint federal  state health insurance program  disabled  -income Americans, according   CBO. The funding cuts  beyond insurance coverage: The loss  that funding could  many rural hospitals that disproportionately rely  federal spending. The CBO estimates that  current version   bill would result  11.8 million people losing health insurance  2034, with  majority  those people losing Medicaid coverage. But  implications could  even bigger. Trump' bill combined with separate policy changes could result   estimated 17 million people losing health insurance, said Robin Rudowitz, director   program  Medicaid   uninsured  health policy research organization KFF. She said those other changes include  regulations that would dramatically limit access  Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage  expiring enhanced ACA  credits. "If   this comes  pass,  would represent  biggest roll back  health insurance coverage ever   federal policy changes," Cynthia Cox, KFF' director   program   ACA, said   analysis published Tuesday. Approximately 72 million Americans  currently enrolled  Medicaid, about -fifth   total U.S. population, according  government data. Medicaid   primary payer   majority  nursing home residents,  pays  around 40%   births. The Trump administration   allies insist  cuts   bill   eliminate waste, fraud  abuse. Democrats have said they break  president' repeated promises   touch  Medicaid program. Medicaid  been    most divisive issues throughout negotiations  both chambers,  some House Republicans have expressed reservations about  deep  cuts . "I  that they want   fraud,  taking  swipe across     going  solve  issue," said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president   American Nurses Association. She said  cuts could shutter hospitals  health centers  rural areas  lead   losses  health-care staff such  nurses.

Millions  Americans will lose coverage

The cuts   bill come from several different provisions,   lion' share  Medicaid savings will come from  changes. One would establish  , strict national work requirement  certain Medicaid beneficiaries ages 19  64. It would require childless adults without disabilities  parents  children older than 14  work, volunteer  attend school   least 80 hours  month  keep their insurance coverage, unless they qualify   exception. Current  prohibits basing Medicaid eligibility  work requirements  work reporting rules, according  KFF. The  work requirement   bill ' kick  until 2026. It  projected  save about $325 billion over  decade,  CBO said. An analysis published June 23   UC Berkeley Labor Center said that  work requirement would cause  most people  lose insurance  "poses  especially draconian barrier  older adults." The center said there   steady drop-  employment after  50   factors "outside [people'] control," including deteriorating health,  discrimination  increasing responsibility  provide care  aging family members. "These same factors make older adults particularly vulnerable  coverage loss under Medicaid work requirements,"  analysis said. People living  rural communities, such  seasonal farmers,  also struggle  find employment  parts   year, Mensik Kennedy said. AARP,  advocacy group focusing  issues affecting those 50  older   U.S., sent  letter over  weekend  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposing another provision that would disqualify people  fail  meet Medicaid work requirements from receiving premium  credits  purchase coverage through  ACA Marketplaces. "This creates  steep coverage cliff  those  their 50s  early 60s — particularly  those nearing retirement  working part-time —    left with  affordable coverage option  ,"  group said.

Hospitals, health centers, patients  rural areas  risk

Another driving source  Medicaid savings will come from  provision that will   gradually reduce   that states  impose  hospitals, health plans  other medical providers. Those provider taxes  designed  help fund state Medicaid programs, with  federal government matching  portion   state' spending. Some members   Trump administration  conservative lawmakers argue that    loophole  states  receive disproportionately more federal funds than they contribute. The bill' restrictions  provider taxes  another strategy called state-directed payments would  spending   combined $375 billion, according   CBO report. But some GOP senators  experts raised concerns that capping provider taxes would threaten  critical funding stream  rural hospitals, which could force them  other health centers  close. Mensik Kennedy said health-care providers  rural areas, particularly critical access hospitals, rely more  Medicaid funding  support them compared with those  urban areas. "You' going   closures  rural hospitals that   backbone  their community  were already struggling financially. You' going   half  million  losses," Mensik Kennedy said. She said pregnant women  rural areas could  forced  drive 30, 40  more miles  deliver  baby, while emergency medical services could have  drive  hour  reach  patient having  heart attack. Patients  rural communities already have higher rates  chronic illnesses  mortality because they have limited access  care, according   Centers  Disease Control  Prevention. Senate Republicans have added  $25 billion fund   bill  help rural hospitals stay open   face  Medicaid cuts. But Mensik Kennedy said that fund  "putting  bucket  water   house fire," adding that    enough  offset  cuts from    provider taxes  other provisions. Cuts  overall Medicaid funding  rural hospitals would exceed 20%  more than half  states, according   report from  National Rural Health Association.

The panel, called  Advisory Committee  Immunization Practices,  ACIP, will also review  childhood vaccination schedule. Earlier this month, Kennedy   stunning step removed  replaced  members   group, which advises  Centers  Disease Control  Prevention.

ACIP members  independent medical  public health experts  review vaccine data  make recommendations that determine   eligible  shots  whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts. But Kennedy appointed some vaccine critics, including Dr. Robert Malone,  could shape immunization policy  affect availability   U.S.

One  work group will review  childhood vaccine schedule, while another will examine shots that have  been subject  reviews  more than seven years,  said.

The latter group  examine  universally recommended hepatitis B vaccine   whether   "wise"  administer  shot  every newborn before they leave  hospital, Kulldorff added. He also said  group could review  combination measles, mumps  rubella shot, along with  chickenpox . Vaccine skeptics have questioned  safety  both shots.

"This  supposed    regular practice   ACIP,     been done   thorough  systematic . We will change that," Kulldorff said.

Dr. Sean O'Leary,  infectious disease expert with  American Academy  Pediatrics, told reporters later Wednesday that reviewing  vaccine schedule  been " anti-vaccine trope  many, many years." O'Leary said many vaccines  "essentially always reviewed  real-time through  number  different mechanisms," including several safety surveillance  disease surveillance tools.

The American Academy  Pediatrics   participate   ACIP meeting  Wednesday because " view   illegitimate," O'Leary said. He added that  organization will continue  provide vaccine schedules  children independently   CDC.

"What ' seeing today,   this were  continue,  medical providers, public health professionals,  entire country   longer going  trust ACIP. That' clear," O'Leary said, saying  goal   reinstate  17 members that Kennedy fired  return  " normal process."

During  full- meeting Wednesday  Atlanta,  panel evaluated data  Covid-19 vaccines  RSV shots. A vote  recommendations   latter  postponed until  group' meeting  Thursday.

Novo Nordisk  April said  would offer Wegovy through several telehealth companies such  Hims & Hers  expand access   blockbuster injection  that    longer  short supply   U.S.

The    Wegovy shortage meant compounding pharmacies were legally restricted from making  selling cheaper, unapproved versions   drug  May 22 – with rare exceptions. Telehealth companies have said patients  still need personalized compounded versions  Wegovy  situations where ' medically necessary.

But Novo Nordisk  Monday said Hims & Hers  "failed  adhere    which prohibits mass sales  compounded drugs" under  "false guise"  personalization. The drugmaker also accused Hims & Hers  "deceptive" marketing that  putting patient safety  risk.

"We expected that  efforts towards compounding personalization would diminish over time. When  didn'  that,    make  choice  behalf  patients," Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk' executive vice president  U.S. operations, told CNBC. "We' been firm  along that patient safety   primary focus."

"Our expectation  that [Hims & Hers'] business focus would transfer toward real, safe, approved medications,"  said. Moore said Novo Nordisk will  incur  fees from terminating  collaboration,    established through  third-party that manages  drugmaker' direct--consumer online pharmacy

In  statement  X, Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said  company  "disappointed   Novo Nordisk management misleading  public."

He added Hims & Hers plays  role  protecting  ability  providers  patients  control individual treatment decisions,  "will  compromise  integrity   platform  appease  third party  preserve  collaboration."

He said Hims & Hers will continue  offer several treatments, including Wegovy,  allow providers  meet  individual needs  patients.

In  note  Monday, Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight said     collaboration increases Hims & Hers' legal risk "substantially." He added that   surprised  partnership, when initially announced,   include  efforts  curb  telehealth company' compounding efforts.

During Food  Drug Administration-declared shortages, pharmacists  legally make compounded versions  brand-name medications. They  also  produced   case--case basis when ' medically necessary   patient, such  when they ' swallow  pill   allergic   specific ingredient   branded drug.

But drugmakers  some health experts have pushed back against  practice, largely because  FDA does  approve compounded drugs.

Novo Nordisk said  will continue offering  branded version  Wegovy through telehealth organizations that "share  commitment  safe  effective medical treatment  patients living with chronic diseases."

Moore said Novo Nordisk  seen several other mass compounding pharmacies reduce  stop making  selling Wegovy knock-offs. He added that  company will "engage   legal front"  with  FDA  ensure that illegal compounding diminishes.

In  release  Monday, Novo Nordisk said  conducted  investigation that found  active ingredients used  Wegovy knock-offs sold  telehealth companies  compounded pharmacies  manufactured  foreign suppliers  China. The drugmaker also cited  report from  Brookings Institution  April, which found that  large share  those Chinese suppliers were never inspected   FDA,  many that were inspected  drug quality assurance violations.

The Food  Drug Administration proposed  dramatic expansion   power  speed  drug reviews.

The agency  Tuesday announced   national priority voucher plan that aims   drug review times  -- months  companies  says  supporting "U.S. national interests."

Currently,  FDA   deadline  10 months after  company files  drug application  make  approval decision. That review period  shortened   months   company  been granted  priority review.

"The ultimate goal   bring more cures  meaningful treatments   American public," FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said   release. The  voucher program  different from  FDA' existing efforts  speed  review processes.

The plan  designed  companies  submit " lion' share"   drug application   agency even before they have final results from  pivotal clinical trial,  process that Makary said would reduce inefficiencies.

The FDA  also grant  accelerated approval  products    voucher program, which will include "enhanced" communication with companies while their application  under review. The agency said   extend  review period   application  particularly complex   there  insufficient information  support .

In  first year   program,  FDA plans  give  limited number  vouchers  companies aligned with what  called "national health priorities."

Since 2008,   cared  boys  girls with cerebral palsy, spina bifida  other neurological disorders. But ,  practice   serious jeopardy,  says, because  recent moves   insurance  health care giant UnitedHealth Group. The story begins  February 2024, when  unit  UnitedHealth experienced  massive hack. The unit, Change Healthcare, shuttered  systems  halted  reimbursements owed  hospitals  doctors like Mazzola. To help providers stay afloat, Optum, another UnitedHealth subsidiary that includes  bank, began offering "temporary," -interest loans. Mazzola' practice  among those tapping into  program —  received $535,000, documents show. The practice began repaying  loans,   January Optum demanded that  repay  money  full  within five business days. "Our practice  doing  BEST  ," Mazzola wrote   email  Optum  Jan. 20. "Please   loan collection people  STOP. We  already  repayment   maximum possible amount monthly." The situation soon  worse. In -February,  stopped receiving reimbursements from UnitedHealthcare.

"They  trying  bankrupt  practice," Mazzola said. "Now, ' going   brain surgery  instead  paying , they' going  take  money themselves."

"It' upsetting."

'$0  your bank account'

The hack  February 2024 affected 190 million patients, making   largest ever involving medical data. UnitedHealth Group ultimately paid  $22 million ransom   cybercriminals. After  pause  reimbursements, many providers took  loans through Optum — over $9 billion  borrowed, according  company filings. Repayment terms   loans were vague, with Mazzola' contract noting only that  practice would have  repay  loan within 30 business days  receiving notice from UnitedHealth Group. But Mazzola  other doctors said they were assured   congressional testimony  Andrew Witty, UnitedHealth Group' former chief executive,  said  May 2024 that  company would seek repayment only when borrowers' businesses were back  normal. Even though Change Healthcare said  restarted claims processing about  month after  breach, doctors  spoke with NBC News said their operations continued  struggle long after, with some saying they   millions   result. Others were forced  close after being crippled   loss  income.

When Optum began demanding repayment  loans  January,  gave borrowers five business days, according  letters reviewed  NBC News. Those  didn' meet  demands could have their UnitedHealthcare reimbursements withheld  repayment,  letters . Mazzola' practice  promised  submit $10,000  month until  $535,000 loan  repaid. It    could afford,  told Optum  emails reviewed  NBC News. Mazzola said  Optum executive told   phone that  repayments weren' enough. And  -February, UnitedHealthcare began intercepting reimbursements owed  Mazzola' practice " repay amounts owed under your agreement with Change Healthcare Operations LLC," documents show.

She received  response,   April  company stopped seizing reimbursements from  practice after  complained   American Medical Association. It waded into  fight  April 11, when Dr. James Madara,  AMA' chief executive, wrote  Roger Connor,  chief executive  Optum Insight, asking that  company stop  payment demands. "Physician practices  still suffering severe financial distress   result   cyberattack nearly 14 months after  breach  first discovered," Madara wrote. "We want Optum  honor  commitment  wait  recover repayment   loans until  physician determines that    appropriate time, because  physicians have relied  Optum' statements." In  statement, Optum said   working with providers " identify flexible repayment plans based   individual circumstances  providers  their practices."

Multiple lawyers interviewed  NBC News reviewed  loan agreement Mazzola' practice signed  characterized    contract  adhesion —  which  party calls  shots   other  little choice   agree. The financial ruin Mazzola  other doctors faced because   hack,  event caused  inadequate security  Change Healthcare, made  loans even more -sided, some lawyers said. As  result, doctors  have legal recourse after  aggressive actions UnitedHealth Group took  extract loan repayments. The central question surrounding UnitedHealth Group' reimbursement actions  "whether they abused their   this remedy  insisting  repayment before   appropriate  them    given  damages that they caused," Daniel Schwarcz,  professor   University  Minnesota  school, said   email. Amid  clashes with doctors, UnitedHealth Group announced earnings  $9 billion from operations   first quarter  2025,  15% jump from  same period last year. Revenue   three months  $110 billion. Even after Change Healthcare restarted claims processing, doctors  spoke with NBC News said they were never reimbursed  many claims because  disruption meant they couldn' submit them within insurers' required time periods. The doctors also said their costs increased after  hack because they    staff members  chase reimbursements. Mazzola,  estimates that  practice lost $1 million because   hack,  asked Optum  reimburse   costs  practice incurred   result   breach. But  terms Optum offered would have barred  from being able    because   hack. So  declined  accept . "I really believed that Optum,   orchestrating these loans, would give physicians  physician groups  reasonable amount  time  repay  loans with  understanding that this financial crisis almost bankrupted ," Mazzola said. "I mean literally, ' talking about $0  your bank account,   have 70 employees  ."

Delays  patient care

Doctors  they weren'  only ones hurt   hack. Patients, , were harmed when providers didn' have  reimbursement revenue needed   medicine,  example. "There were    delays  patient care   result  ," said Dr. Pruvi Parikh,  allergist  immunologist  New York City   medical director   practice with  locations  New York  15  New Jersey. Parikh' group borrowed $400,000 from Optum  survive  hack. By    2024,   repaid   $102,000  , documents show. On Jan. 7, Optum threatened  withhold reimbursements  Parikh' practice   rest   loan wasn' repaid  days,  email shows. "Coming  with that amount  money  five business days   possible   majority  private practices," Parikh said   interview. "Not only  they  give  time   back   feet, they were like, 'Pay  .'" While  practice  Optum' demand,  estimated    $2 million because   hack. In  statement, Change Healthcare said  started clawing back funding   provided "more than  year post  event  with services restored." The company said   reaching   those "that have  been responsive  previous calls  email requests  more information." The main reason doctors like Parikh  Mazzola   this crucible, antitrust experts  physicians ,  that UnitedHealth Group operates  many cogs   nation' health care machinery. By acquiring  array  health care operations  recent years—including physician practices  pharmacy benefits management, technology, claims processing  financial services — UnitedHealth Group  exert market muscle over weaker participants like doctors  patients. Federal antitrust lawyers concerned about possible monopolistic activities have sued health care companies  recent years. In 2022,  years before  Change Healthcare hack,  Justice Department   states  New York  Minnesota sued  stop UnitedHealth Group' acquisition   claims processor, saying  would reduce competition  health care insurance markets. Because Change Healthcare dominates  claims clearinghouse business,  government argued,  purchase  UnitedHealth Group would give  conglomerate information about  rivals' insurance plans work,  competitive advantage. UnitedHealth disagreed, saying   strong "firewalls" between units that would prevent sensitive data from being shared throughout  company. Optum,  subsidiary that  houses Change Healthcare, would protect external customers' data from being shared with UnitedHealthcare   affiliates   deal went through,  company said. That argument seemed  persuade  federal judge hearing  case  Washington, D.C.,  Trump appointee. In  October 2022 decision greenlighting  $13 billion Change acquisition, U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols cited  company' data-sharing firewalls  weighing "strongly against  government' position." Now, doctors  UnitedHealthcare' diverting reimbursements  repay Optum loans shows  kind  data-sharing  government  concerned about.

He waited  Barca -  would have waited longer    . In January,  move collapsed because   club' inability  register players such  Dani Olmo  Pau Victor. But this summer,    want  opportunity  escape.

There   financial penalty  Barcelona fail  register ,  nobody   club believes  will come  that. The expectation  that money will  raised, players will  moved,   squad list will feature Rashford' name.

Officially, Rashford arrives   winger. Unofficially,    much more. Hansi Flick values flexibility above almost anything -   Rashford  sees  player   play left, right,  centrally. A wide forward   lead  press,  understands space,    slot into  variety  roles.

The conversation between both  them suggested  manager that knew very well   circumstances  potential,   player that  desperate  impress.

Deco initially leaned toward Liverpool' Luis Diaz,  very publicly Athletic' Nico Williams  another option. But Rashford (  said, with  respect   those that wanted )  hoping  stars aligned   arrival.

When Robert Lewandowski  unavailable, Rashford will compete with Dani Olmo  Ferran Torres   number nine role. But when     pitch, ' likely  will operate from  left, where   always looked most dangerous.

In  presentation, Rashford  accompanied   brothers, Dwaine  Dane,  well  Arturo Canales,  intermediary  helped navigate  transfer.

Even Lamine Yamal played  role, quietly nudging  process along through messages  Instagram. A digital friendship born  mutual admiration - Lamine grew  playing Fifa with Rashford   screen;  they will share  pitch.

"They probably think   like  legend," said  source close   players.

That admiration  mutual. Rashford sees  Lamine  brightest talent. In   training sessions they have shared, Rashford  seen  talent   serious work,  also, when entering  changing room,  Dani Olmo said  seems like  kindergarten. So many young kids!

The choice  shirt number   accidental. Rashford will wear 14 -  number Johan Cruyff made iconic with Ajax   Netherlands. But   also  number  another hero  : Thierry Henry. A   history.

Barcelona have secured  option   Rashford  30m euros (£26m) before next summer. If they  , they'  5m euros (£4.3m)   penalty.

Rashford,   part,  accepted  15% wage reduction (  25% when bonuses  factored ), bringing  gross annual salary  about 14m euros (£12.1m).

Rashford comes  Spain hungrier  wiser. He grew  watching La Liga  British TV. Fell  love with Barcelona. Dreamed   Nou Camp. Now,   here - just   club,   stadium, begin   chapter.

Spanish football  taught  that adaptation takes time. But  Rashford rescales  heights  know   reach, Barcelona  have pulled  something rare  modern football:  bargain.

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Palm trees  Uruguay  more than just plants, they  icons, much like olive groves  Greeks  cherry blossoms   Japanese.

The treasured trees lining    world’ longest sidewalks through Montevideo, Uruguay’ capital,  adorn  swanky Atlantic beach resorts  Punta  Este have recently come under ruthless attack.

Across  small South American country, palm trees  falling prey   fierce enemy measuring just 5 centimetres (2 inches)  length: The  palm weevil.

First  elegant fronds droop. Then  tell-tale holes appear   trunk. Soon enough,  tree  tilting toward collapse.

The weevil  devoured thousands  Uruguay’ palm trees since  unexplained arrival from Southeast Asia  2022. But authorities  only  waking    threat   landscape  municipalities transforms  fears grow that  country' beloved palms could  wiped .

“We  late  addressing this,” Estela Delgado,  national director  biodiversity  Uruguay' Ministry  Environment, acknowledged last month. “But   doing  with great commitment  seriousness.”

The insect   devastating impact   found  60 countries around  world  nowhere else  South America. Authorities first detected    town  Canelones, bordering Montevideo, where  insect killed more than 2,000 palm trees  less than  month.

Weevils quietly wreak destruction  boring through  open scars  pruned palms  laying hundreds  eggs inside. When larvae hatch, they tunnel through trunks     trees’ internal tissue. Death strikes within weeks.

The Uruguayan government    task force  combat  plague  March. In May, Environment Minister Edgardo Ortuño declared  fight against   palm weevil “ national priority."

As  this year,     proliferated  eight   country' 19 regions, including Montevideo. Half   capital' 19,000 palm trees have been infected, estimates Gerardo Grinvald, director  pest control company Equitec, which helps authorities combat  .

The insect first attacks decorative Canary palms,  tree   many pictures  Uruguay’ sunny landscape, before moving onto  date palms.

“It’  invisible pest,” Grinvald said, explaining  challenge  identifying  infestation when  starts. As  result, landowners fail  isolate  quarantine their trees, fueling  weevil' crawl across  country.

The Montevideo municipality this year earmarked $70,000  chemical pesticide sprays  insecticide injections meant  kill bugs inside infested trunks, with  goal  saving some 850 trees   city’ prominent Parque Rodó,  scenic urban park along  coast.

In  southeast corner  Uruguay, home  Punta  Este,  beachy, palm-fringed haven  - elites from  over  world, authorities recently allocated $625,000  efforts  dispose  infected trees  lure weevils away from affected areas with pheromone traps  other methods.

“We  losing  palm trees,” lamented Montevideo resident Rafael  Santos   walked    Parque Rodó. “They  historic  Uruguay,   part  .”

As  weevil' march continues unabated, authorities  fear native trees  Uruguay' UNESCO biosphere reserve bordering Brazil will fall victim next, potentially facilitating  spread   parasite across  unprepared continent.

France' justice minister  transferring 100   country’ most dangerous inmates   high-security prison  prevent them from running criminal operations from behind bars

PARIS -- They  France ' most dangerous drug kingpins, according   country' justice minister — prison inmates  wealthy  powerful that even behind bars, they  continue  order assassinations,  narco-trafficking operations  launder money.

Flexing  powers  minister  charge   French penal system, Gérald Darmanin' solution   problem  contentious. He  moving 100 inmates —   describes  “France’ biggest criminals” — into  austere maximum security penitentiary   country' north that critics   echoes  tough U.S. prisons.

The move  also possibly vote-catching  Darmanin,   joined  growing field  possible successors  President Emmanuel Macron after  next election, less than  years away.

In  newly reinforced Vendin--Vieil prison,  selected inmates will  locked  individual cells  23 hours  most days.

Largely   from  world, Darmanin argues they will  longer  able  fuel drug-related violence, which  become  political issue ahead   2027 presidential election.

“We  here  guarantee that they ' speak   outside, that they ' continue their trafficking outside, that they ' corrupt prison officers, magistrates, police officers  gendarmes," Darmanin said  primetime evening television after  first 17 inmates were transferred this week  Vendin--Vieil from other, less secure facilities.

France    long history  both notorious prisons ( Bastille)  prisoners — both real (Napoleon)  fictional ("The Count  Monte Cristo").

Still, Vendin--Vieil' lock- conditions  exceptional, similar   ultra-secure “Supermax” prison   United States  Italy’ tough “carcere duro” incarceration rules  Mafia members.

Vendin--Vieil already houses some  France' most infamous prisoners — including Salah Abdeslam, lone survivor   team  Islamic State extremists that terrorized Paris  2015, killing 130 people    bomb attacks.

To make    specially selected 100 inmates — some already convicted, others  -trial detention — many other Vendin--Vieil inmates were moved . The newcomers will  grouped together   prison'  “Section  Combatting Organized Crime,” with reinforced security  regulations,  equipped with systems  block mobile phone signals  drones.

Among those   list  Vendin--Vieil  Mohamed Amra, nicknamed “The Fly,"  staged  escape last year that killed  guards  then fled  Romania before   captured  returned  France.

The newcomers will have just  hour     prison exercise yard,  groups   more than five. The rest   time, they will mostly  confined  individual cells fitted with holes  prison guards  handcuff them before moving them  with ratchet systems  inmates ' yank  doors open  shut when they have   unlocked.

They will  guarded  250 wardens — elsewhere,  ratio  usually 20 guards  100 inmates, Darmanin told French broadcaster TF1.

Instead  unlimited calls with family members from prison phones, they will  limited   maximum   hours, twice  week —  restriction that Darmanin says will make monitoring their conversations easier.

Prison visiting rooms have also been equipped with security glass dividers,  prevent physical contact between inmates  visitors. Darmanin says this will prevent mobile phones  other contraband from being smuggled . The  Vendin--Vieil inmates also ' have  rights accorded  other prisons  intimate time with partners  family members.

Darmanin said  conditions will  “extremely hard"   necessary because France risks “tipping into narco-banditry”   absence  tough decisions.

Critics  Darmanin  taking  gamble  grouping together  many inmates  describes  dangerous.

“From what I know, even when they’ placed under  strictest isolation, they’  smart that they always find ways  communicate with each other," said May Sarah Vogelhut,  attorney     17 prisoners transferred this week. "It' almost more like  networking club  billionaire narco-traffickers."

She  others also   tough conditions could inflict  unacceptable toll   prisoners' mental health.

Vogelhut said  22-year- client   major drug dealer   southern French port city  Marseille   convicted  sentenced  25 years  torturing  victims. He  appealing  sentence.

Held  isolation  another prison before  transfer  Vendin--Vieil,  biggest concern   glass barrier that will prevent  from hugging  mother  touching other visitors, Vogelhut said.

“What shocks   most  this  detention center  that  visits happen through  security glass intercom —  know, like what  French   American movies, when  person  behind  glass   talk through  phone,”  said.

“I find that inhumane. I mean, imagine that   spends 10 years there —  10 years,  ’   mother?"  said. “I think ’ going  dehumanize them."

First   minister  public accounts, then  interior minister  since last December  justice minister, Darmanin  proven     Macron' most loyal lieutenants.

His close ties with  unpopular president,  '  again, could work against Darmanin   runs  2027. But  government experience  tough--crime rhetoric could work   favor with voters.

Darmanin  announced plans   least  other high-security prison units  convicted  accused drug traffickers,   them   overseas territory  French Guiana.

WASHINGTON -- Director  National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard this month declassified material that  claimed proved  “treasonous conspiracy”   Obama administration  2016  politicize U.S. intelligence  service  casting doubt   legitimacy  Donald Trump’ election victory.

As evidence, Gabbard cited newly declassified emails from Obama officials   five-year- classified House report  hopes  undermining  intelligence community' conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted  boost Trump  denigrate  Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

Russia’ activities during  2016 election remain some   most examined events  recent history. The Kremlin' campaign   subsequent U.S. government response were  subject   least five major investigations   Republican- House  Senate intelligence committee;  Justice Department special counsels;   department' inspector general.

Those investigations either concluded —  accepted  conclusion — that Russia embarked   campaign  interfere   election through    social media  hacked material.

The House- probe, conducted  Trump allies, also concurred that Russia   election interference campaign  said  purpose    chaos   U.S. rather than boost Trump. Several   reports criticize  actions  Obama administration officials, particularly   FBI,    dispute  fundamental findings that Moscow sought  interfere   election.

The Associated Press  reviewed those reports  evaluate  Gabbard’ claims stack :

CLAIM: “The intelligence community   assessment: that Russia   have  intent  capability    impact  outcome   U.S. election leading   Election Day. The same assessment  made after  election.” — Gabbard  Fox News  Tuesday.

The documents Gabbard released   support  claim. She cites  handful  emails from 2016  which officials conclude that Russia   intention  manipulating  U.S. vote count through cyberattacks  voting systems.

President Barack Obama' administration never alleged that voting infrastructure  tampered with. Rather,  administration said Russia   covert influence campaign using hacked  stolen material from prominent Democrats. Russian operatives then used that information  part  state-funded media  social media operations  inflame U.S. public opinion. More than  dozen Russians were indicted  2018  connection with those efforts.

Republican- investigations  Congress have affirmed that conclusion,   emails that Gabbard released   contradict that finding.

CLAIM: “There   shift,  180-degree shift, from  intelligence community' assessment leading    election    that President Obama directed  produced after Donald Trump   election that completely contradicted those assessments that  come previously.” — Gabbard  Fox News  Tuesday.

There   shift.

The emails Gabbard released show that  Department  Homeland Security official  August 2016 told then-Director  National Intelligence James Clapper there  “ indication   Russian threat  directly manipulate  actual vote count.”

The public assessment  Obama administration made public  January 2017 reached  same conclusion: “DHS assesses that  types  systems Russian actors targeted  compromised were  involved  vote tallying."

CLAIM: The Obama administration "manufactured  January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew  false promoting  LIE that Vladimir Putin   Russian government helped President Trump   2016 election.” — Gabbard  Truth Social Wednesday.

The material declassified this week reveals some dissent within  intelligence community about whether Putin wanted  help Trump  simply inflame  U.S. public. That same question    partisan divide   House Intelligence panel when  examined  matter several years later.

Gabbard’ memo released last week cites  “whistleblower”   says served   intelligence community   time    quoted  saying that  could  “concur  good conscience” with  intelligence community' judgment that Russia   “decisive preference”  Trump.

Such dissent  debate   unusual   drafting  intelligence reports. The Republican- Senate Intelligence Committee examined whether there   political interference   Obama administration’ conclusions  reported that “ analysts expressed that they were free  debate, object  content,  assess confidence levels,   normal  proper.”

In 2018, Putin directly addressed  question  whether  preferred Trump   press conference  Helsinki even   sidestepped  question about whether  directed    subordinates  help Trump.

“Yes, I ,” Putin said. “Because  talked about bringing  U.S.-Russia relationship back  normal.”

CLAIM: “They used already discredited information like  Steele dossier — they knew   discredited   time.” — Gabbard  Fox News  Tuesday.

The dossier refers   collection  opposition research files compiled   former British , Christopher Steele, whose work  funded  Democrats during  2016 election.

Those files included uncorroborated tips  salacious gossip about Trump’ ties  Russia,   importance   Russia investigation  sometimes been overstated.

It    basis   FBI’ decision  open  investigation  July 2016 into potential coordination between  Trump campaign  Russia,  Justice Department' inspector general found. Some   records released  Gabbard this week also reveal that    Central Intelligence Agency human source close   Kremlin that  agency primarily relied    conclusion that Putin wanted  help Trump  hurt Clinton,   Steele dossier.

FBI agents   case didn' even come  possess  dossier until weeks into their inquiry. Even , Trump supporters have seized   unverified innuendo   document  undercut  broader Russia investigation. Many  Steele’ claims have since been discredited  denied.

It  true, however, that  FBI  Justice Department relied  part   Steele dossier  obtain surveillance warrants  eavesdrop   communications   former Trump campaign adviser,  inspector general found. FBI agents continued  pursue those warrants even after questions arose about  credibility  Steele' reporting.

The dossier  also summarized — over  objections  then-CIA Director John Brennan,   said —   -page annex   classified version   intelligence community assessment.

After watching data sets  altered  disappear from U.S. government websites  unprecedented ways after President Donald Trump began  second term,  army  outside statisticians, demographers  computer scientists have joined forces  capture, preserve  share data sets, sometimes clandestinely.

Their goal   make sure they  available   future, believing that democracy suffers when policymakers ’ have reliable data  that national statistics should  above partisan politics.

“There  such smart, passionate people  care deeply about  only  Census Bureau,    statistical agencies,  ensuring  integrity   statistical system. And that gives  hope, even during these challenging times,” Mary Jo Mitchell, director  government  public affairs   research nonprofit  Population Association  America, said this week during  online public data-users conference.

The threats   U.S. data infrastructure since January have come  only from  disappearance  modification  data related  gender, sexual orientation, health, climate change  diversity, among other topics,  also from  cuts  workers  contractors   been guardians  restricted-access data  statistical agencies,  data experts said.

“There  trillions  bytes  data files,  I ' even imagine  many public dollars were spent  collect those data. ... But right , they' sitting someplace that  inaccessible because there   staff  appropriately manage those data,” Jennifer Park,  study director   Committee  National Statistics, National Academies  Sciences, Engineering,  Medicine, said during  conference hosted   Association  Public Data Users (APDU).

In February,  Center  Disease Control  Prevention’ official public portal  health data, data..,  taken down entirely  subsequently went back . Around  same time, when  query  made  access certain public data from  U.S. Census Bureau’ most comprehensive survey  American life, users  several days   response that said  area  “unavailable   maintenance” before access  restored.

Researchers Janet Freilich  Aaron Kesselheim examined 232 federal public health data sets that  been modified   first quarter  this year  found that almost half  been “substantially altered," with  majority having  word “gender” switched  “,” they wrote this month  The Lancet medical journal.

One   most difficult tasks  been figuring  what' been changed since many   alterations weren' recorded  documentation.

Beth Jarosz, senior program director   Population Reference Bureau, thought    good shape since   previously downloaded data  needed from  National Survey  Children' Health   February conference where   speaking, even though  data  become unavailable. But then  realized   failed  download  questionnaire  later discovered that  question about discrimination based  gender  sexual identity  been removed.

“It'   thing  team didn' have,” Jarosz said  this week' APDU conference. “And they edited  questionnaire document, which should have been  historical record.”

Among  groups that have formed this year  collect  preserve  federal data   Federation  American Scientists' dataindex., which monitors changes  federal data sets;  University  Chicago Library’ Data Mirror website, which backs   hosts -risk data sets;  Data Rescue Project, which serves   clearinghouse  data rescue-related efforts;   Federal Data Forum, which shares information about what federal statistics have gone missing  been modified —   also being done   American Statistical Association.

The outside data warriors also  quietly reaching   workers  statistical agencies  urging them  back   data that  restricted from  public.

“You ' trust that this data  going   here tomorrow,” said Lena Bohman,  founding member   Data Rescue Project.

Separately,  group  outside experts  unofficially revived  long-running U.S. Census Bureau advisory committee that  killed   Trump administration  March.

Census Bureau officials '  attending  Census Scientific Advisory Committee meeting  September, since  Commerce Department, which oversees  agency, eliminated . But  advisory committee will forward  recommendations   bureau,  demographer Allison Plyer said   heard that some agency officials  excited   committee' -emergence, even  ' outside official channels.

“We will send them recommendations   ' expect them  respond since that would  frowned upon,” said Plyer, chief demographer  The Data Center  New Orleans. “They just aren' getting  outside expertise ...  they want expertise, which  understandable from nerds.”

BEIJING -- European leaders demanded  more balanced relationship with China   summit with President Xi Jinping   Chinese capital  Thursday.

Focusing their opening remarks  trade, they called  concrete progress  address Europe' yawning trade deficit with China.

“As  cooperation  deepened,  have  imbalances,” European Commission President Ursula   Leyen said. “We have reached  inflection point. Rebalancing  bilateral relation  essential. Because   sustainable, relations need   mutually beneficial.”

Expectations were    talks, initially supposed  last  days  scaled back  . They come amid financial uncertainty around  world, wars   Middle East  Ukraine,   threat  U.S. tariffs. Neither  EU  China  likely  budge   issues dividing   economic juggernauts.

European Council President António Costa called  China    influence over Russia  bring       Ukraine —  long-running plea from European leaders that  likely  fall  deaf ears.

He signaled  possible agreement  climate, saying  looks forward  “ strong joint political message” from  summit ahead  annual U.N. climate talks  November  Brazil. That could follow their talks with China' Premier Li Qiang later Thursday.

Xi called  China  Europe  deepen cooperation  mutual trust  provide stability   increasingly complex international environment, China' state broadcaster CCTV reported online. They should  aside differences  seek common ground,  said,  phrase  often uses  relationships like   with  EU.

Besides  trade imbalance   Ukraine , Von  Leyen  Costa were expected  raise concerns about Chinese cyberattacks  espionage,  restrictions   export  rare earth minerals   human rights record  Tibet, Hong Kong  Xinjiang.

The EU, meanwhile,  concerns about  looming trade battle with  United States.

“Europe  being very careful   antagonize President Trump even further  looking maybe  close  China,    that doesn’ make this summit easier,” said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist   European Policy Center. "It will  very hard  achieve something concrete.”

China' stance  hardened   EU, despite   olive branches, like  suspension  sanctions  European lawmakers  criticized Beijing' human rights record  Xinjiang,  region  northwestern China home   Uyghurs.

China believes   successfully weathered  U.S. tariffs storm because   aggressive posture, said Noah Barkin,  analyst   Rhodium Group think tank. Barkin said that Beijing' bold tactics that worked with Washington should work with other Western powers.

"China  come away emboldened from  trade confrontation with Trump. That  reduced  appetite  making concessions   EU,"  said. “Now that Trump  backed down, China sees less   need   Europe.”

China   EU’ second-largest trading partner  goods, after  United States, with about 30%  global trade flowing between them. Both China   EU want   their economies ties  stabilize  global economy,  they share some climate goals.

But deep disagreements  through those overlapping interests.

China   EU have multiple trade disputes across  range  industries,   disagreement   sharp  their enormous trade imbalance.

Like  U.S.,  27-nation bloc runs  massive trade deficit with China — around 300 billion euros ($350 million) last year. It relies heavily  China  critical minerals, which  also used  make magnets  cars  appliances. When China curtailed  export  those minerals   wake  U.S. President Donald Trump' tariffs, European automakers cried foul.

The EU  tariffs  Chinese electric vehicles  order  support   carmakers  balancing  Beijing'  heavy auto subsidies. China would like those tariffs   revoked.

The rapid growth  China’ market share  Europe  sparked concern that Chinese cars will eventually threaten  EU’ ability  produce   green technology  combat climate change. Business groups  unions also fear that  jobs  2.5 million auto industry workers could    jeopardy,  well those  10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly  EV production.

China  also launched investigations into European pork  dairy products,  placed tariffs  French cognac  armagnac. They have criticized  EU regulations  medical equipment sales,  fear upcoming legislation that could further target Chinese industries, said Alicia García-Herrero,  China analyst   Bruegel think tank.

In June,  EU announced that Chinese medical equipment companies were   excluded from  government purchases  more than 5 million euros (nearly $6 million). The measure seeks  incentivize China  cease  discrimination against EU firms,  bloc said, accusing China  erecting “significant  recurring legal  administrative barriers   procurement market.”

European companies  largely seeing declining profitability  China. But  EU  leverage because China still needs  sell goods   bloc, García-Herrero said.

“The EU remains China’ largest export market,  China  every intention  keep  this , especially given  pressure coming from  U.S.,”  said.

It  unclear   initial plan   summit   days  curtailed  just   Beijing.

The clear majority  Europeans favor increasing   Ukraine  more sanctions  Russia.

The latest sanctions package  Russia also listed Chinese firms, including  large banks that  EU accused  being linked  Russia'  industry. China' commerce ministry said that   “strongly dissatisfied with  firmly opposed "  listing  vowed  respond with “necessary measures  resolutely safeguard  legitimate rights  interests  Chinese enterprises  financial institutions.”

Xi  Putin have   close relationship, which  also reflected   countries’ ties. China  become  major customer  Russian   ,   source   technologies following sweeping Western sanctions  Moscow. In May, Xi attended  Victor Day celebration alongside Putin  Moscow,  didn' attend  similar EU event  Brussels celebrating    World War II.

Von  Leyen  Costa will press Xi  Li  slash their support  Russia,  with likely little effect.

Buffeted between  combative Washington   hard-line Beijing,  EU  more publicly sought  alliances elsewhere, inking  trade pact with Indonesia, heaping praise  Japan  drafting trade deals with South America  Mexico.

“We also know that 87%  global trade  with other countries — many  them looking  stability  opportunity. That   I  here  this visit  Japan  deepen  ties,” Von  Leyen said  Tokyo during  EU-Japan summit     Beijing.

“Both Europe  Japan   world around  where protectionist instincts grow, weaknesses  weaponized,  every dependency exploited. So   normal that  like-minded partners come together  make each other stronger."

Promoting ties with Europe   third  Japan’  2025 military doctrine, after sustaining defense links with  U.S.  investing  capabilities  home like missiles, satellites, warships,  drones.

WASHINGTON -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton   wife, Angela,  longtime owners   $1.5 million house   gated community outside Dallas. In 2015, they snapped   second home  Austin. Then another.

The problem: Mortgages signed   Paxtons contained inaccurate statements declaring that each  those three houses  their primary residence, enabling  -estranged couple  improperly lock   interest rates, according   Associated Press review  public records. The lower rates will save  Paxtons tens  thousands  dollars  payments over  life   loan, legal experts .

The records also revealed that  Paxtons collected  impermissible homestead  break    those homes,  they have routinely flouted lending agreements  some  their other properties.

It   federal  state crime  knowingly make false statements  mortgage documents. It' also against    Texas  collect  homestead  break   separate properties. Violating  terms   mortgage could allow lenders recourse  seek full payment   loan, according  legal experts.

The mortgage revelations  likely  become fodder   Republican primary   U.S. Senate seat  which Paxton  seeking  topple  incumbent, John Cornyn. The situation  further complicated   Trump administration' criminal pursuit  Democrats over similar issues.

President Donald Trump  accused    political foes — Sen. Adam Schiff  California  New York Attorney General Letitia James —  committing mortgage fraud, though legal experts   circumstances  less serious.

The Democrats have long been objects  Trump’   having  various investigations into  conduct  president    business executive.

Paxton, himself,  weighed    investigation  James, saying  hoped authorities would look into  conduct. “I hope that  ’ done something wrong, I hope that ’ actually held accountable,”  told supporters last month.

The Justice Department  launched  criminal investigation  James, FBI director Kash Patel told Fox News  May. The department received  criminal referral  Schiff last week from  Federal Housing Finance Agency,  director William Pulte confirmed   social media post.

Neither  Justice Department   FHFA responded   inquiry about whether they  investigate Paxton, .

James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, urged  Trump administration  investigate Paxton instead.

“If this administration  genuinely interested  rooting  fraud,  appears they should stop wasting their time   baseless  discredited allegations against  New York Attorney General James  turn their attention  Texas,” said Lowell,  prominent Washington attorney whose past clients include Hunter Biden, Ivanka Trump  Jared Kushner.

In  statement, Marisol Samayoa,  Schiff spokeswoman, blasted  criminal referral  “ transparent attempt”  Trump “ punish  perceived political    committed  holding   account.” She added that Schiff disclosed   lenders that  owned another home that   principal residence  sought guidance from  attorney.

It  unlikely that Paxton,  staunch Trump ally, will face  same federal scrutiny  James  Schiff. It’ equally doubtful that Paxton will face much legal trouble  Texas: His office     primary agencies tasked with investigating allegations  mortgage fraud.

Ken Paxton   spokesman   respond  multiple requests  comment. Angela Paxton,    state senator  Texas,   respond  requests made through  office.

Documents reviewed   AP show  Paxtons hold mortgages  three homes —   suburban Dallas,   Austin — that  each listed  their primary residence. The designation comes with  considerable financial upside.

Interest rates  primary homes  significantly lower than those  mortgages  secondary homes  investment properties, saving buyers tens  thousands  dollars —   more — over  life   loan.

Making  case against Paxton would require "establishing both that Paxton  aware   contents   mortgage document,  also that   actively aware   time that  signed  that this   going    primary residence,” said Jennifer E. Laurin,  professor   University  Texas Law School  Austin.

Legal experts    possible that  Paxtons’ lenders prepared  documents  that  couple   carefully review them before signing.

Even  that were  case, some legal experts  that Paxton,   attorney  Texas’   enforcement officer, ought  have known better.

“If  filled  lender documents knowing that they were false, then that   false statement  obtain  mortgage  favorable terms. That would  actionable,” said Arif Lawji,  veteran Texas real estate attorney. “He’  chief enforcement officer. You have   accountable  stuff   that’ wrong.”

Low interest rates    only perk  Paxtons secured, records show. In 2018, they simultaneously collected homestead property  breaks  their family’ home  suburban Dallas,  well    $1.1 million home  Austin, property records   statements show.

A homestead  break   property  reduction that  homeowner  only eligible  collect   property that  also their primary home.

The suburban Dallas home  where  Paxtons’ family  long resided. It’ where Ken  Angela Paxton  registered  vote. It  located   state Senate district that Angela Paxton represents   Legislature, which Ken Paxton held before  election  2014   attorney general. It’ also where Ken Paxton’ Senate campaign website until recently said  lived.

Lawji said  Paxtons’ simultaneous collection   homestead  breaks appears    more clearcut violation. That  because  must obtain  form  submit   taxing authorities  receive such   break, making   “intentional ,”  said.

The  break  worth several thousand dollars,  fact that confounded real estate lawyers. “Why would       this,” Lawji said, “when    attorney general? That’  bigger question   than  money, when   AG  have  enforce this .”

Separately, land records indicate  Paxtons  have violated  terms   least  mortgages  other houses they . The mortgage   home  College Station, Texas, says  property    Paxtons’ exclusive   cannot  rented . Doing  would  grounds  terminating  mortgage,  document states. The home  been listed  rent  real estate websites -- since  least 2022.

Ken Paxton also holds  $1.2 million mortgage   “5 bedroom luxury cabin”  Broken Bow, Oklahoma, that   rent  Airbnb  other short-term rental sites, records show. The property’ mortgage stipulates that  cannot  rented .

Representatives  Stifel Bank, Cornerstone Home Lending  Benchmark Mortgage, which issued  mortgages  question,   respond  requests  comment.

Paxton’ real estate dealings   many ways distinct from those  James  Schiff,  Democrats targeted   Trump administration.

The investigation  James centers  forms  signed  2023 while helping  niece   home  Virginia. One form stated that James intended  occupy  home   “principal residence.” But  other documents,  New York attorney general made clear    intention  living there. An email   mortgage loan broker  weeks before  signed  documents stated  property “WILL NOT   primary residence.”

“As I’ said from  beginning,  prosecutors want  know that truth about Attorney General James’ mortgage applications,   ready  waiting with  facts,” said Lowell, James’ attorney.

For over  decade, Schiff owned homes  Maryland  California,  state  represents, that were both designated   primary residence. In 2020, then  congressman, Schiff designated  Maryland property   second home —  step Paxton   taken.

Paxton’ real estate dealings    first time   drawn scrutiny   conduct while  office.

Before  election  attorney general, Paxton, then  state senator, admitted  2014  violating Texas securities   paid  fine.

He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment  securities charges while serving  attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped  2024. Other alleged misdeeds  office    impeachment  Texas’ GOP-controlled House  2023. He  acquitted   trial   Senate.

Angela Paxton   cast  vote   impeachment trial  recently filed  divorce, citing Ken Paxton’ infidelity  other “recent discoveries.” She   elaborate.

What ultimately unleashed  impeachment push  Paxton’ relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul,  pleaded guilty this year   count  making  false statement   financial institution.

In 2020, eight  aides  Paxton’ office told  FBI they were concerned  state’   enforcement official  misusing  office  help Paul over  developer’ unproven claims about  elaborate conspiracy  steal $200 million   properties.

The House impeachment managers accused Paxton  attempting  interfere  foreclosure lawsuits  issuing legal opinions  benefit Paul. They also alleged that Paul employed  woman with whom Paxton   affair  exchange  legal help  that  developer paid  expensive renovations   attorney general’ home  Austin.

That would   same house that  declared  mortgage documents   third primary residence.

The reason,  analysts: The ECB' policymakers simply ' know  outcome  talks between  EU' executive commission   Trump administration. Trump first   20% tariff  EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure   pace  talks, then sent  EU  letter informing officials   potential 30% tariff.

SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found    oldest burial sites   world   cave  Israel, where  well-preserved remains  early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged  pits.

The findings  Tinshemet Cave  central Israel, published   academic journal earlier this year, build  previous discoveries  northern Israel     growing understanding   origins  human burial.

Of particular interest  archaeologists  objects found beside  remains that  have been used during ceremonies  honor  dead  could shed light    ancient ancestors thought about spirituality   afterlife.

“This   amazing revolutionary innovation   species," said Yossi Zaidner,    directors   Tinshemet excavation   professor  archaeology  Hebrew University  Jerusalem. "It’ actually  first time   starting   this behavior.”

Archaeologists working  Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered  remains  five early humans that date back  around 110,000  100,000 years , according  various technologies.

The skeletons were discovered  pits  carefully arranged   fetal position, which  known   burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such  basalt pebbles, animal remains  fragments  ochre,  reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.

These objects, some sourced from hundreds  kilometers (miles) away,   known practical   daily life,  experts believe they were part  rituals meant  honor  dead.

Tinshemet Cave   dark slash  central Israel’ rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside  around  cave   unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls “   three  four most important sites  study  human evolution  behavior during  Paleolithic time.”

The Paleolithic , also known   Stone Age because   onset  stone tools, lasted from  early  3.3 million years  until around 10,000 years . Tinshemet Cave  from  Middle Paleolithic , roughly between 250,000  30,000 years .

Some   Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published  March  Nature Human Behavior. A  discovery were  remains  five early humans, including  full skeletons  three isolated skulls with other bones  teeth. Also  note were more than 500 differently sized fragments    orange ochre,  pigment created  heating iron-rich stones   certain temperature — evidence that early humans   means  create decorative objects.

“Here    really complex   behaviors,  related  just food  surviving,” Zaidner said.

Using hand chisels  delicate, -sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years  excavate  site. The field work, which started  2016,  usually done over  summer months. This year,  dozen archaeology undergraduate  graduate students fanned  across  site, painstakingly documenting  removing each fragment  tool, object  bone.

At  entrance   cave,  skull     early humans  slowly emerging from  rock sediment;  will  years before   fully excavated.

Tinshemet  exceptionally important  archaeologists because  local climate preserved  bones, tools,  ornaments  good condition, unlike many other parts   world where these items were lost  time, said Christian Tryon,  professor   University  Connecticut   research associate   Human Origins Program   Smithsonian Institution,    involved   study.

The skeletons  objects were  well preserved because   from frequent fires, likely  rituals. This large amount   mixed with rainfall  Israel' acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions  perseveration. One skeleton   such good condition archaeologists could    fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath  head.

Tryon said  Tinshemet findings  bolstering earlier discoveries from  similar burial sites dating back   same period  northern Israel — Skhul Cave  Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave  excavated almost 100 years ,  Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years , when archaeological practices were more haphazard.

“There were  many uncertainties with those sites,  this  confirming ’  pattern  know,  they’ really nailing down  dates,” Tryon said.

Tinshemet  helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started  become more widespread during this time, representing  shift   early humans treated their dead.

Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa,  Homo naledi species –  ancient cousin  Homo sapiens –  have been intentionally placing their dead  caves  early  200,000 years . But many archaeologists said  findings  controversial  there   enough evidence  support  claim  intentional burials.

In ancient times, Israel   bridge between Neanderthals from Europe  Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups  early humans   area,  believe  groups interacted   have interbred.

Experts have been studying   full skeletons brought from Tinshemet  years,  ’ still unclear  they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens,  hybrid population  another group altogether.

The   subgroups created opportunities  different groups  early humans  exchange knowledge  express identity, said Zaidner. It’ around this time that archaeologists first  examples  early jewelry  body painting, which could  ways early humans started outwardly belonging   certain group, drawing boundaries between “”  “them,”  said.

Israel Hershkovitz,  physical anthropologist  Tel Aviv University   -director   Tinshemet site, said  concept  cemeteries  prehistoric life  important because  symbolizes “ kind   territory.”

He said that same kind  claim over land where ancestors  buried still echoes   region. “It’  kind  claim  make   neighbors, saying ’this   territory, this part   land belongs   father   forefather'      .”

NEW YORK -- The fertility rate   U.S. dropped   -time   2024 with less than 1.6 kids  woman,  federal data released Thursday shows.

The U.S.  once among only   developed countries with  rate that ensured each generation  enough children  replace itself — about 2.1 kids  woman. But   been sliding  America  close   decades  more women  waiting longer  have children  never taking that step  .

The  statistic    with fertility rates  western European countries, according  World Bank data.

Alarmed  recent drops,  Trump administration  taken steps  increase falling birth rates, like issuing  executive order meant  expand access   reduce costs   vitro fertilization  backing  idea  “baby bonuses” that might encourage more couples  have kids.

But there'  reason   alarmed, according  Leslie Root,  University  Colorado Boulder researcher focused  fertility  population policy.

“We’ seeing this  part   ongoing process  fertility delay. We know that  U.S. population  still growing,   still have  natural increase — more births than deaths,”  said.

The U.S. Centers  Disease Control  Prevention released  statistic   total fertility rate with updated birth data  2024.

In  early 1960s,  U.S. total fertility rate  around 3.5,  plummeted  1.7  1976 after  Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose  2.1  2007 before falling again, aside from  2014 uptick. The rate  2023  1.621,  inched down  2024  1.599, according   CDC' National Center  Health Statistics.

Birth rates  generally declining  women  most  groups —  that doesn’ seem likely  change   near future, said Karen Guzzo, director   Carolina Population Center   University  North Carolina.

People  marrying later  also worried about their ability  have  money, health insurance  other resources needed  raise children   stable environment.

“Worry    good moment  have kids,”  that’  birth rates  most  groups   improving,  said.

Asked about birth-promoting measures outlined   Trump administration, Guzzo said they ’ tackle larger needs like parental leave  affordable child care.

“The things that they  doing  really symbolic   likely  budge things  real Americans,”  said.

The CDC'  report, which  based   more complete review  birth certificates than provisional data released earlier this year, also showed  1% increase  births — about 33,000 more — last year compared   prior year.

That brought  yearly national total  just over 3.6 million babies born.

But this  different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year  women  their late 20s  30s. However,   report found birth rate declines  women  their 20s  early 30s,   change  women  their late 30s.

What happened? CDC officials said     recalculations stemming from  change   U.S. Census population estimates used  compute  birth rate.

That' plausible, Root said. As  total population  women  childbearing  grew   immigration,  offset small increases  births  women  those  groups,  said.

The  neighbors  Southeast Asia have  occasional military clashes  nationalist rivalries  hundreds  years.

Here   timeline  what  happened.

1907

The border disputes   traced back   1907  created during French colonial rule  Cambodia. The    basis  Cambodia’ claims  certain parts   border,   vagueness   conflicting interpretations,  Thailand contested .

The countries tried  resolve  dispute diplomatically,   issue  never settled completely, even after transnational bodies like  International Court  Justice intervened  1962. At stake were areas like centuries- historical temples.

2008-11

Military fighting  broken  intermittently since 2008. The last time tensions turned deadly   2011, when  fighting focused   jungle border area including ancient temples  which both sides  laid claim. Each side blamed  other  starting  prolonging  fighting.

The  nations declared  cease-fire after seven days  fighting killed  least 15 people  displaced tens  thousands  civilians. That same year,  United Nations court ordered   nations  withdraw troops  establish  demilitarized zone,   court left unresolved  would control  larger disputed territory, where troops kept clashing.

House Cats With Bird Flu Could Pose  Risk  Public Health

pets that spend time outdoors  likely caught   hunting diseased rodents  wild birds.

Now,  small  growing number  house cats have gotten sick from H5N1,  bird  strain driving  current U.S. outbreak, after eating  food  drinking unpasteurized milk. Some  those cats died.

The strain  bird  currently circulating   adapted  efficiently spread among people. And there have been  known cases  --human transmission during  current outbreak  H5N1.

Still, there' always been  risk that cats, which  arguably only semi-domesticated, could bring home  disease from  midnight prowl.

"Companion animals,  especially cats,  100%  public health risk  terms   risk  zoonotic transmission  people," said virologist Angela Rasmussen, PhD,  studies disease progression  emerging viruses   University  Saskatchewan' Vaccine  Infectious Disease Organization.

This  because  snuggle with  sleep   with  cats. When '  looking, cats drink from  water glasses  walk  kitchen counters. So,  owners should  aware   ongoing spread  bird . "By reducing  risk  your cats,  reduce  risk  yourself," Rasmussen said.

Rasmussen doesn' think  owners should  afraid their cats will give them bird   said taking precautions  good  pets,   public health.

Signs  bird   cats include runny nose  discharge around  eyes, explained Michael Q. Bailey, DVM, president-elect   American Veterinary Medical Association.

H5N1 also causes neurological problems like dizziness  seizures, which  symptoms  rabies, . Rabies  almost always fatal,   poses  threat  human health,   animal suspected  having  viral disease must  euthanized. Bailey encourages people  ensure pets  --date  their vaccinations.

Veterinarian Jane Sykes, PhD,  specializes  infectious diseases  cats  dogs   University  California Davis School  Veterinary Medicine, said people should  assume ' bird   their   sick -- even  their animal spends time outdoors  eats   diet. Upper-respiratory illnesses  common  cats, while H5N1  "still pretty rare."

Sykes gives  indoor , Freckles, regular kibble exclusively. She told NPR  KFF Health News    concerns about Freckles getting H5N1 because  heating process  making   canned  food kills viruses.

More Cases  Cats, More Risk  Humans

Some people feed their pets  meat  unpasteurized milk because they think '  more nutritious  natural diet. The American Veterinary Medical Association' website discourages this   foodborne pathogens like salmonella  listeria,    highly pathogenic H5N1.

By keeping pets healthy, veterinarians play  essential role  protecting humans from zoonotic diseases. The American Veterinary Medical Association says  risk  H5N1 spilling over from     person  "considered extremely ,   zero."

State  local public health agencies, including those  Los Angeles County  Washington state, have issued similar warnings against  food diets  pets.

Concerns  human health  partly   FDA announced last month    requiring    food companies  update their safety plans  protect against bird .

This came after  Oregon Department  Agriculture discovered   that  "strictly  indoor "  contracted H5N1  died after consuming  frozen turkey product made     food brand Northwest Naturals. It stated that "tests confirmed  genetic match between  virus     frozen  food   infected ."

Northwest Naturals voluntarily recalled that batch   frozen turkey-based product. The company told KFF Health News  NPR that  recall involved " small product "  that   concerns about  accuracy   Oregon Agriculture Department' testing.

Los Angeles County' public health department said five cats from  households tested positive  bird  after drinking unpasteurized  milk from  Raw Farm dairy  California' Central Valley.

Raw Farm voluntarily recalled  milk  cream after retail products tested positive  H5N1,   denies  food safety issues, calling  concern " political issue."

Veterinarians also warn  owners   allow cats unsupervised time outside  there'  risk  them getting H5N1  interacting with other animals that might carry  disease.

"This   very scary virus, given that   infect  many different host species," said Bruce Kornreich, DVM, PhD, director  Cornell University' Feline Health Center.

At least  instance    infecting  person with bird  occurred  2016. As NPR reported,  veterinarian  New York City caught  virus after having close contact with infected cats. The  experienced mild symptoms  quickly recovered.

In that case,  strain  bird   H7N2,   H5N1 that   circulating   U.S.

H7N2   very different type  virus, Sykes explained. But  said  shows that --human transmission  avian influenza  theoretically possible.

There '    research  transmission  bird  from companion animals like cats  dogs  humans, though Rasmussen agreed ' definitely  concern: The more infections  have  animals, " more your luck  potentially going   ."

Most people  have caught H5N1  agricultural workers   direct contact with infected poultry  cattle. Of  least 67 confirmed human cases  H5N1   U.S., there' been  fatality   immunocompromised person   contact with birds.

In general, zoonotic disease researchers want more H5N1 surveillance  companion animals   types. Even   human death toll  H5N1 remains relatively ,  remains  public health risk.

Chances  Mutation

Part   concern with this H5N1 outbreak  that bird  viruses change. Just   mutations could make this strain adept  spreading between people. And  more people  catch H5N1,  more likely  would adapt   more efficient, said Suresh Kuchipudi, PhD, MVSc,  virologist   University  Pittsburgh School  Public Health, where  researches zoonotic diseases. Kuchipudi  studied H5N1  cats.

Another concern  something called reassortment. If  animal  person  infected with  viruses  once,  viruses  trade genetic material, creating something . This  common  influenza,  virologists    lookout   case  which  bird  reassorts  make  virus that'  more contagious,  potentially more virulent.

Virologist Rasmussen   more worried about this happening  pigs. Human respiratory physiology  more like that  swines than felines. So ,  current outbreak  H5N1   reached commercial  operations. Rasmussen hopes  stays that .

Kuchipudi said that reassortments  relatively rare events,   outcome  completely unpredictable. Sometimes  results  benign, though   likely  reassortment that involved  avian virus that    1918  pandemic, which killed  estimated 50 million people. In  century since, virologists have established  global surveillance network  monitor influenza viruses.

You ' outrun   diet. Food  lack  exercise fuels obesity, study finds

Back   1800s, obesity  almost -existent   United States. Over  last century, ' become common here   other industrialized nations, though  remains rare among people  live more traditional lifestyles, such   Hadza hunter-gatherers  Tanzania.

So what' changed? One common explanation  that,  societies have developed, they' also become more sedentary,  people have gotten less active. The assumption  that   result,  burn fewer calories each , contributing   energy imbalance that leads  weight gain over time, says Herman Pontzer,  professor  evolutionary biology  global health  Duke University  studies  human metabolism  evolved.

But   major  study published   journal PNAS, Pontzer   international team  collaborators found that'   case. They compared  daily total calorie burn  people from 34 different countries  cultures around  world. The people involved   spectrum from hunter-gatherers  farming populations with  obesity rates,  people  more sedentary jobs  places like Europe   U.S., where obesity  widespread.

"Surprisingly, what  find  that actually,  total calories burned    really similar across these populations, even though  lifestyle   activity levels  really different," says Pontzer.

And that finding offers strong evidence that diet —   lack  physical activity —   major driver  weight gain  obesity   modern world.

"This does sort  really    face  what     anecdotally assumed  driving     weight gain  obesity today," says Deirdre Tobias,  obesity  nutritional epidemiologist   Brigham  Women' Hospital  Boston   Harvard Chan School  Public Health. Tobias   involved    research.

Different activity levels, same calorie burn

In  study, researchers examined data  more than 4,200 adult   women. Study participants were given  special water  drink that contained isotopes which came   their urine. These isotopes allow scientists  determine exactly  much energy  person expends –  just  active movement  also  energy  takes  keep  hearts beating,  nervous systems functioning  just generally stay alive.

"This allows     really accurate measure   many calories people burn   over  course  about  week," Pontzer says.

When they adjusted  body size, Pontzer   colleagues found that people from populations with higher obesity rates burned only slightly less total energy   than those from populations that weighed less. These differences  energy expenditure didn' contribute much   differences  obesity rates among populations,  says.

While   seem implausible that someone    foraging  berries   burns about  same amount  daily calories , , your typical office worker, Pontzer says  fits with what scientists have been learning about   bodies burn calories. Pontzer' past research  suggested that  bodies tend  adjust   expend energy  keep  total calorie burn stable within  pretty narrow range.

"So   burn more   energy every   physical activity,  exercise, after  while  bodies will adjust  spend less energy   other tasks that  sort  ' notice going    background," Pontzer says.

Changing  message  obesity

The  findings have  implications  obesity. If differences  calorie burn ' explain  some countries have higher obesity rates than others, then  must  something else. "And that would  diet," says Tobias,  praised  design    study.

"It' 100%  diet," agrees Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director   Food  Medicine Institute   Friedman School  Nutrition Science  Policy  Tufts University. "And I think then  question , what   about  diet?"

Mozaffarian   involved   study,   says  adds  other recent research that suggests food   biggest driver  obesity. He points  there' been  major shift   food supply  recent decades — which   dominated  ultra-processed food. In  subanalysis   data  some   populations, Pontzer   colleagues found that people  countries that  more  their calories from ultra-processed foods tended  have more obesity  higher body  percentages.

"For decades ' been telling Americans that ' lazy, ' your fault, '  moving enough, ' eating  much," Mozaffarian says. "And I think what this study shows  that there' really complicated biology happening  that  food  driving this."

Now, this doesn' mean there'  reason  exercise. After , ' good   mental  physical health   many ways that have nothing   with weight.

What borrowers should know about student loan changes   One Big Beautiful Bill

If '  federal student loan borrower  about  become , your head   spinning.

On July 4, when President Trump signed  One Big Beautiful Bill Act into ,  also greenlit  history-making overhaul   federal student loan system —  that will affect  lives  many,   most,   United States' nearly 43 million student loan borrowers.

And       unpack, with , tighter borrowing limits  dramatically reduced repayment options,  name just     sweeping changes.

In May,  explained this overhaul,  conceived  House Republicans. Now that  Senate compromise  been signed into , here'  updated guided tour   final changes.

Let' start with  elephant   room:

President Biden' SAVE plan  ending

The most generous repayment plan   Biden- Saving   Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. But    generous, with   monthly payments  expedited loan forgiveness, that Republicans have   successfully argued  court that    generous. In fact,  nearly 7.7 million borrowers currently enrolled  SAVE have been  legal limbo  months, without interest accruing  required monthly payments.

That' about  change.

"For  practical purposes, I would  SAVE  just kind  dead  this point, even  ' technically  life support," said Preston Cooper   conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI).

This month,  U.S. Education Department announced that  Aug. 1, SAVE borrowers will, once again,  their balances grow — with interest. Because  SAVE plan  still enjoined, though, borrowers '   required  make payments. Still, Cooper said that many borrowers, rather than watch their loans balloon, will likely want  move   different plan.

Roxanne Garza, director  higher education policy   liberal-leaning EdTrust, worries that  relatively last-minute announcement about interest accrual will cause problems   Education Department, which  roughly half  staff    Trump administration.

"I think what will likely happen    will   rush  people trying  take action that will, again, likely create  even bigger backlog," said Garza.

Under  One Big Beautiful Bill Act, borrowers  SAVE will have  change plans  July 1, 2028, when SAVE will  officially shut down. If they wait, though they currently '  required  make payments, they will  their loans explode with interest.

But    plans that   creates '  ready   year,   department'  website, meant  help borrowers navigate their repayment options, does  reflect this confusing  landscape, except   banner that says: "Loan Simulator will  updated   later date  reflect recent legislative changes."

Beginning July 1, 2026,  loans will  subject   borrowing limits

Undergraduates '   changes  their loan limits. But '  very different story  graduate students  parents.

For graduate students,  limits will make  harder  lower-  middle-income borrowers  attend pricier graduate programs. The current grad PLUS loan allows students  borrow    cost  their graduate program,  Republicans  shutting  down this time next year.

After that, grad students' borrowing will  capped  $20,500  year with  lifetime graduate school loan limit  $100,000,   drop from  previous   $138,500.

How   deal will this ? AEI' Cooper  been crunching  numbers  said, "Just under 20%  master' students borrow above  proposed limits."

Borrowers working toward  professional graduate degree (.., medical   school) will have their borrowing capped  $50,000  year  their lifetime  increased from $138,500  $200,000.

Parents  caregivers   parent PLUS loans  help students   college will also   loan limits. They will  capped  $20,000  year ,  aggregate,  $65,000  child.

Cooper says only -third  parent PLUS borrowers with dependent children currently take  more than this  annual loan .

The  also sets   lifetime limit,  undergrad  graduate loans combined,  $257,500  person.

Repayment options  borrowers  changing dramatically

Republicans  reducing repayment options   borrowers from  current seven plans down    plans. The  plans :

1. The standard plan

New borrowers will  assigned  repayment window  between 10  25 years, depending   size  their debt, with equal monthly payments like  home mortgage.

Under this plan, borrowers with larger debts would qualify   longer repayment period:



Owe less than $25,000,  repay over 10 years.

Owe $25,000  more  less than $50,000? Repayment expands  15 years.

Owe $50,000  more  less than $100,000: Repay over 20 years.

Anyone owing $100,000  more would repay over  25-year period.

2. The Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)

For borrowers worried they ' earn enough  cover  inflexible monthly payments    standard plan, Republicans have also created  Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP).

On RAP, payments would largely  based  borrowers' total adjusted gross income (AGI).



Borrowers earning  more than $10,000 would  asked   $10  month.

Earn more than $10,000   more than $20,000,  your payment will  based  1%  AGI.

More than $20,000   more than $30,000,  would  2%  AGI      income scale.

Repayment tops   10%  AGI  borrowers earning $100,000  year  more.

Current borrowers will also have access  this  RAP plan,  well   some older plans.

RAP   latest   long line  income-based repayment plans. How does  compare with previous plans?

Monthly payments  many middle-income borrowers  RAP will  lower compared with earlier plans, according  multiple experts. But RAP    generous   Biden- SAVE plan, which, again,  being phased .

RAP will require even  lowest-income borrowers  make  minimum monthly payment  $10, ending  $0 option  previous plans  making  more expensive  these borrowers.

This  $10 minimum payment wouldn' make   difference   government' coffers, said Jason Delisle,  spoke  NPR  May, when   studying student loan policy   Urban Institute. Delisle  since been appointed   position   Trump administration.

Delisle said  purpose  RAP'  $10 minimum payment likely stems from "emerging research that requiring people  make some payment each month  good because  keeps them connected   loan  makes  less likely that they' default."

But some borrower advocates worry that this  minimum payment could have  opposite effect.

For  lowest-income borrowers, asking  $120  year  "significant," EdTrust' Garza told NPR  May. "I think having that   required minimum payment will likely push more borrowers into default."

But RAP also comes with    perks that borrowers will likely appreciate.

RAP will waive  interest that  left after  borrower makes their monthly payment.

If their monthly payment  $50  they  $75  month  interest,  government will waive  remaining $25.

The result: Borrowers will  longer  their loans grow, which   common downside  previous income-driven repayment plans.

Borrowers  RAP will also  their balances  down every month.

The government will pitch    $50  make sure lower-income borrowers  their principal balances shrink.

For example,  borrower whose monthly payment makes only  $30 dent  their principal would   government knocking   extra $20  month.

Borrowers whose monthly payments already reduce their principal balance   least $50 would   extra help from  government.

"It'  form  monthly loan forgiveness," Delisle said. "It'  drip, drip, drip  loan forgiveness, rather than waiting    payout     20 years."

The loan forgiveness math will change.

While previous plans offered forgiveness after 20  25 years,  RAP would extend that  360 qualifying payments,  30 years. That'   difference, said AEI' Cooper.

Borrowers with typical levels  debt " typical incomes  their degree level  almost always gonna   well before they  that 30-year mark," Cooper said. "So  ' going into RAP, I wouldn'  thinking about forgiveness because ' probably gonna    before   30 years."

In short,  days  what Delisle called "  payout"  over.

But wait! Current borrowers have another loan forgiveness option (sort ).

In addition  RAP,  older plan known  Income-Based Repayment (IBR) will still  available  borrowers  take  their loans before July 1, 2026.

Part   reason IBR remains  that, unlike other income-driven repayment plans, IBR wasn' created   Education Department. It  created  Congress   codified  statute.

How does IBR work? For borrowers with loans older than July 2014, their payments  capped  15%  discretionary income. Payments  younger loans  capped  10%.

With  Biden- SAVE plan being wound down, Delisle said, most lower-  middle-income borrowers would likely have lower monthly payments    RAP compared with IBR.

But, Delisle said, borrowers with older loans might still want  enroll  IBR  they' been  repayment  close  20  25 years,  they  qualify  loan forgiveness.

That' because,  IBR, -2014 loans qualify  forgiveness after 25 years. For newer loans, ' just 20 years — both considerably shorter than RAP' 30-year schedule.

One  caveat   this: The Education Department  temporarily stopped processing  loan forgiveness  borrowers  IBR because   legal actions surrounding  SAVE plan, according   statement from Education Department Deputy Press Secretary Ellen Keast.

Keast said  Biden- rule explaining SAVE "provided  authority  count forbearances  IBR toward loan forgiveness" , because that rule  been frozen   courts,  department ' accurately determine loan forgiveness under IBR. "Discharges will resume  soon   Department  able  establish  correct payment count," Keast said.

The department told NPR that  borrowers  make payments after they' eligible  forgiveness will eventually   refund.

Ghislaine Maxwell engaged   "significant pattern  dishonest conduct," enabled  participated   abuse  multiple teenage girls,  failed  take responsibility   crimes.

That   assessment   federal prosecutors  brought  criminal case against  longtime associate  Jeffrey Epstein  sent   prison  20 years.

Now, three years later --  amid  ongoing controversy surrounding  Trump administration' handling   Epstein files --  Department  Justice  decided  approach Maxwell, 63,  purportedly learn more about  knowledge  whether Epstein'  trafficking extended  people other than himself.

Prosecutors' sentencing memorandum after Maxwell' 2021 conviction offers  frank assessment  Maxwell' "monstrous" crimes  casts doubt   honesty ahead   meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche later this week.

"In short,  defendant  lied repeatedly about  crimes, exhibited  utter failure  accept responsibility,  demonstrated repeated disrespect      Court," federal prosecutors with  U.S. Attorney' Office   Southern District  New York wrote  June 2022.

Blanche    meet with Maxwell   coming days  potentially learn more information "about anyone   committed crimes against victims."

Ahead   meeting, Maxwell' appellate counsel David Oscar Markus vowed that  would "testify truthfully"  thanked President Donald Trump   "commitment  uncovering  truth  this case."

Maxwell continues  appeal  conviction. Her lawyers have asked  Supreme Court  throw   case, arguing  -prosecution agreement that Epstein made with federal prosecutors  Florida  2007 allegedly barred  subsequent prosecution  New York more than  decade later.

The Trump administration asked  high court earlier this month  deny Maxwell' petition.

In their sentencing memo  2022, defense lawyers argued Maxwell "should  bear   punishment  which Epstein should have been held responsible."

"Epstein   mastermind, Epstein   principal abuser,  Epstein orchestrated  crimes   personal gratification. Indeed,  Ghislaine Maxwell never   profound misfortune  meeting Jeffrey Epstein over 30 years ,  would   here," they argued.

Prosecutors said Maxwell enabled Epstein  directly participated   abuse.

According  prosecutors,  testimony elicited  Maxwell' trial demonstrated    vital participant  Epstein' crimes, offering  veneer  respectability  trust before  convicted  offender abused dozens  teenage girls.

She identified  preyed  vulnerable young women, groomed them  normalize their abuse  participated   abuse -- directly enabling    most significant  trafficking operations  US history, prosecutors said.

"Maxwell befriended  victims,  their trust, slowly broke down their boundaries,  normalized sexual abuse," prosecutors wrote    memo. "Maxwell' victims trusted :    seemingly respectable woman  showed interest  them  promised  help them. She     entire operation   scheme,  Epstein could  have committed these crimes without ."

According   government' sentencing memorandum, Maxwell "personally engaged  sexual abuse when  fondled  breasts"  three victims. She  also " person   most frequently   room when Epstein abused"    victims,  testified under  name Jane.

"Years  sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating psychological harm: none  this could have happened without Maxwell," prosecutors wrote.

Maxwell repeatedly lied  officials, prosecutors said

Prosecutors repeatedly emphasized  trial that Maxwell should   trusted, arguing that  "engaged   significant pattern  dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about  character."

They identified  least four instances  which Maxwell allegedly lied  made dishonest representations   authorities   civil lawsuits.

During  2016 deposition,  said under oath that  never gave Annie Farmer,  victim  testified  trial,  massage. Farmer' testimony  trial "established that   ," prosecutors said.

She allegedly lied  court officials during  interview about  assets. When  court denied  bail application,  judge noted that Maxwell "misrepresent[]  facts  Pretrial Services ,  extension,  Court."

Prosecutors said that Maxwell lied  November 2021 when  told  court, "I have  committed  crime"  response   question about whether  engaged  plea discussions with  government.

Maxwell also falsely claimed    assets when  interviewed with  court' probation office, despite having previously claimed   $22 million  assets. She also declined  provide information about  circumstances   marriage, prosecutors said.

"In short,  defendant decides when  wishes  disclose facts   Court,  those facts shift when  serves  defendant' interests," prosecutors wrote.

Maxwell profited from relationship with Epstein, prosecutors said

Prosecutors alleged that Maxwell lived  "remarkable life  privilege"  received approximately $23 million from Epstein during  timeframe  their alleged crimes.

Maxwell also received  townhouse  New York from Epstein  benefited from  lavish lifestyle, prosecutors allege. Epstein also bequeathed  $10 million from  estate, though Maxwell   received those funds because  estate   probate.

"As part   disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified, groomed,  abused multiple victims, while  enjoyed  life  extraordinary luxury  privilege. In  wake, Maxwell left  victims permanently scarred with emotional  psychological injuries," prosecutors wrote.

Maxwell deflected responsibility   crimes, prosecutors said

At  sentencing, some   witnesses  testified  trial urged Judge Alison Nathan  impose  severe sentence    harm Maxwell  caused   apparent lack  remorse.

A witness  testified under  name Kate described Maxwell  " manipulative, cruel  merciless person  only uses kindness  manipulate  generosity  seek recognition."

"The lack  remorse  responsibility taken  Ghislaine    ruined  lives  countless women  children  exactly    tell that  doesn' think what    wrong. She   sorry,   would   again," Kate said.

Annie Farmer asked  judge  consider  "ongoing suffering   many women whom  abused  exploited"   Maxwell' inability  accept  consequences   crimes continued  harm  victims.

"I    bear  mind  Maxwell' unwillingness  acknowledge  crimes,  lack  remorse   repeated lies about  victims created  need  many    engage   long fight  justice that  felt like  black hole sucking   precious time, energy  well-being  much  long , things that cannot  replaced," Farmer said.

When Maxwell briefly addressed  court,  said that  "empathize[] deeply with    victims  this case"  that meeting Epstein years earlier   "greatest regret."

Her lawyers have long argued that Maxwell  unfairly targeted  Epstein' crimes after  death,   statement  sentencing echoed that argument.

"Jeffrey Epstein should have been here before   . He should have stood before   those years ,"  said. "He should have stood before   2005, again  2009,  again  2019,    many times   accused, charged,  prosecuted. But today    about Epstein ultimately. It      sentenced    victims  address ,   alone,  this court."

The data nerds  fighting back.

After watching data sets  altered  disappear from U.S. government websites  unprecedented ways after President Donald Trump began  second term,  army  outside statisticians, demographers  computer scientists have joined forces  capture, preserve  share data sets, sometimes clandestinely.

Their goal   make sure they  available   future, believing that democracy suffers when policymakers ’ have reliable data  that national statistics should  above partisan politics.

“There  such smart, passionate people  care deeply about  only  Census Bureau,    statistical agencies,  ensuring  integrity   statistical system. And that gives  hope, even during these challenging times,” Mary Jo Mitchell, director  government  public affairs   research nonprofit  Population Association  America, said this week during  online public data-users conference.

The threats   U.S. data infrastructure since January have come  only from  disappearance  modification  data related  gender, sexual orientation, health, climate change  diversity, among other topics,  also from  cuts  workers  contractors   been guardians  restricted-access data  statistical agencies,  data experts said.

“There  trillions  bytes  data files,  I ' even imagine  many public dollars were spent  collect those data. ... But right , they' sitting someplace that  inaccessible because there   staff  appropriately manage those data,” Jennifer Park,  study director   Committee  National Statistics, National Academies  Sciences, Engineering,  Medicine, said during  conference hosted   Association  Public Data Users (APDU).

In February,  Center  Disease Control  Prevention’ official public portal  health data, data..,  taken down entirely  subsequently went back . Around  same time, when  query  made  access certain public data from  U.S. Census Bureau’ most comprehensive survey  American life, users  several days   response that said  area  “unavailable   maintenance” before access  restored.

Researchers Janet Freilich  Aaron Kesselheim examined 232 federal public health data sets that  been modified   first quarter  this year  found that almost half  been “substantially altered," with  majority having  word “gender” switched  “,” they wrote this month  The Lancet medical journal.

One   most difficult tasks  been figuring  what' been changed since many   alterations weren' recorded  documentation.

Beth Jarosz, senior program director   Population Reference Bureau, thought    good shape since   previously downloaded data  needed from  National Survey  Children' Health   February conference where   speaking, even though  data  become unavailable. But then  realized   failed  download  questionnaire  later discovered that  question about discrimination based  gender  sexual identity  been removed.

“It'   thing  team didn' have,” Jarosz said  this week' APDU conference. “And they edited  questionnaire document, which should have been  historical record.”

Among  groups that have formed this year  collect  preserve  federal data   Federation  American Scientists' dataindex., which monitors changes  federal data sets;  University  Chicago Library’ Data Mirror website, which backs   hosts -risk data sets;  Data Rescue Project, which serves   clearinghouse  data rescue-related efforts;   Federal Data Forum, which shares information about what federal statistics have gone missing  been modified —   also being done   American Statistical Association.

The outside data warriors also  quietly reaching   workers  statistical agencies  urging them  back   data that  restricted from  public.

“You ' trust that this data  going   here tomorrow,” said Lena Bohman,  founding member   Data Rescue Project.

Separately,  group  outside experts  unofficially revived  long-running U.S. Census Bureau advisory committee that  killed   Trump administration  March.

Census Bureau officials '  attending  Census Scientific Advisory Committee meeting  September, since  Commerce Department, which oversees  agency, eliminated . But  advisory committee will forward  recommendations   bureau,  demographer Allison Plyer said   heard that some agency officials  excited   committee' -emergence, even  ' outside official channels.

“We will send them recommendations   ' expect them  respond since that would  frowned upon,” said Plyer, chief demographer  The Data Center  New Orleans. “They just aren' getting  outside expertise ...  they want expertise, which  understandable from nerds.”

PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian José Natal  Silva often tends   modest coffee plantation   interior  Rio  Janeiro state   middle   night, sacrificing sleep  fend  pests that could inflict harm   precious crops.

But anxiety  troubled  shut- even more  recent weeks, following President Donald Trump’ announcement earlier this month   50% tariff  Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect  drive down  price  coffee  Brazil.

Da Silva sighed   recounted  fears, sitting    earth surrounded   glossy green arabica coffee shrubs,   small municipality  Porciuncula.

“We’  because  struggle  much. We spend years battling   somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart,  ’ going  lose everything,”  Silva said. “How   going  survive?”

Trump’ tariff  Brazil  overtly political. In  public letter detailing  reasons   hike,  U.S. president called  trial   ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro,  “ witch hunt.” Bolsonaro  accused  masterminding  coup  overturn  2022 election loss  left-leaning President Luiz Inácio Lula  Silva.

The tariff  sparked ripples  fear  Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties   American market such  beef, orange juice —  coffee. Minor coffee producers   import  will  their margins  adds   uncertainty already generated   increasingly   unpredictable climate.

Brazil,  world’ largest coffee producer, exports around 85%   production. The United States   country’  coffee buyer  represents around 16%  exports, according  Brazil’ coffee exporters council Cecafe.

The president  Cecafe’ deliberative council, Márcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that  thinks  U.S. will continue  import Brazilian coffee, even with  hefty tariff. “It’ obvious that neither  United States   other source  give   Brazil, even  ’ tariffed,”  said.

But  tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee’ competitiveness   U.S.  naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio,  professor  global agribusiness  Insper business school  Sao Paulo.

“There’     quickly redirect  coffee production  other markets,” Gilio said. “This principally affects small producers,  have less financial power  make investments  support themselves   period like this.”

Family farmers produce more than -thirds  Brazilian coffee. They   majority  Rio state’ northwestern region, where most   state’ coffee production lies.

Coffee farming   primary economic activity  these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil’ largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains  layered with symmetrical lines  coffee shrubs.

Da Silva,  wore  straw   protection from     crucifix around  neck, owns around 40,000 coffee trees. He started working   fields when   12.

Besides coffee,  grows cassava, squash, bananas, oranges  lemons     chickens that provide fresh eggs. “We have them because   fear   being able  . We wouldn’ manage  everything were bought, because  profit  very ,”  said.

Last year, drought — made more likely  human-caused climate change — devastated large swathes   Silva' production. The reduction  supply pushed coffee prices ,  only after many small-scale farmers  already sold  their crops.

Since peaking  February, prices  arabica have fallen, dropping 33%  July, according   University  Sao Paulo’ Center  Advanced Studies  Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.

“When  make  investment, counting   certain price  coffee,  then when    sell   price  20-30% less than  calculated,  breaks  producers,” said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31,  also owns  modest plantation  around 35,000 coffee trees   nearby municipality  Varre-Sai.

Life    fields  tough, according  Menezes Freitas.

During harvest season,  sometimes gets   3 ..  turn   coffee drier, going    late  midnight. The rest   year  less intense,  still, there     breaks because there’ always work  ,  said.

Menezes Freitas,   expecting  first child  October, said  tariff’ announcement increased  fears   future.

“It’ scary. It feels like ’  shaky ground. If things  worse, what will  ? People will start pulling  their coffee  finding other ways  survive because they ’ have  means  continue,”  said.

In addition  slashing  value   coffee beans, Menezes Freitas said  tariff will impact machinery  aluminum — goods that producers like   every .

“We hope this calms down. Hopefully, they’ come  their senses  remove that tariff. I think  would  better  both  United States  Brazil,”  said.

BANGKOK -- Armed clashes broke  Thursday between Thailand  Cambodia  long-disputed border areas, rapidly escalating months-long tensions.

The fighting included gunfire exchanges  shelling  rocket fire, which Thai authorities said killed  least nine Thai civilians  injured 14 others  three provinces. Thailand responded with  strikes.

It   second armed confrontation since  Cambodian soldier  shot dead  May   major escalation that came hours after   countries downgraded diplomatic relations following  land mine explosion that injured Thai soldiers.

Clashes  ongoing   least  areas along  border,  Thai Defense Ministry said. The first clash Thursday morning happened   area near  ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along  border  Surin  Cambodia’ Oddar Meanchey province.

Here’ what  know about  dispute between   Southeast Asian neighbors.

The dispute flared  May after armed forces  Thailand  Cambodia briefly fired  each other   relatively small, contested border area that each country claims   .

Both sides said they acted  self-defense. One Cambodian soldier  killed.

While  countries said afterwards they agreed  -escalate  situation, Cambodian  Thai authorities continued  implement  threaten measures short  armed force, keeping tensions high.

Thailand added tight restrictions   border with Cambodia that stopped almost  crossings except  students, medical patients  others with essential needs. On Thursday, Thai authorities announced they were sealing  border entirely.

Cambodia also banned Thai movies  TV shows, stopped  import  Thai fuel, fruits  vegetables  boycotted some   neighbor’ international internet links  power supply.

Nationalist passions  both sides have inflamed  situation.

Thailand' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra  suspended from office July 1   investigated  possible ethics violations over  handling   border dispute following  leaked phone call with  senior Cambodian leader.

In  June call, Paetongtarn referred  Cambodian former Prime Minister Hun Sen  “uncle”  criticized Thai military leadership, remarks framed  critics  disrespectful  national sovereignty.

Hun Sen  succeeded    Hun Manet  2023  remains influential  Senate president. He   longtime friend   father, Thaksin Shinawatra,  popular  divisive former prime minister,  they became estranged over  border dispute.

The leaked call sparked widespread outrage  protests. Paetongtarn' Pheu Thai party- coalition also weakened when  second-largest partner,  Bhumjaithai Party, withdrew support, citing  perceived softness toward Cambodia.

Paetongtarn  apologized  argued  comments were  negotiating tactic. Her ally, former Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai,  appointed acting prime minister.

Border disputes  long-standing issues that have caused periodic tensions between   neighbors. Thailand  Cambodia share more than 800 kilometers (500 miles)  land border.

The contesting claims stem largely from  1907  drawn under French colonial rule that  used  separate Cambodia from Thailand. Cambodia  been using     reference  claim territory, while Thailand  argued    inaccurate.

The most prominent  violent conflicts have been around  1,000-year- Preah Vihear temple.

In 1962,  International Court  Justice awarded sovereignty over  temple area  Cambodia. The ruling became  major irritant  bilateral relations.

Cambodia went back   court  2011, following several clashes between  army  Thai forces that killed about 20 people  displaced thousands. The court reaffirmed  ruling  Cambodia' favor  2013.

Cambodia  again turned   international court  resolve  border disputes  Thailand  rejected  court' jurisdiction.

Australia’ S & P ASX 200 slid 0.3%  8,709.40. Taiwan' Taiex gained 0.2% while India’ BSE Sensex shed 0.7%.

Doctor' team makes synthetic blood from hemoglobin,  protein that nourishes  body with oxygen. The researchers extract hemoglobin from expired blood  enclose  protein   bubble  , essentially creating artificial  blood cells.

The protective bubble   innovation that Doctor thinks will solve  safety problems caused  other attempts  making synthetic blood. These other efforts also used hemoglobin,  exposed hemoglobin   toxic  organs,  says.

"We have  veil  hemoglobin inside  cell. It'  artificial cell that makes  safe  effective," Doctor says.

The scientists then freeze-  artificial  blood cells into  powder that  stay good until  emergency.

NEW YORK -- The fertility rate   U.S. dropped   -time   2024 with less than 1.6 kids  woman,  federal data released Thursday shows.

The U.S.  once among only   developed countries with  rate that ensured each generation  enough children  replace itself — about 2.1 kids  woman. But   been sliding  America  close   decades  more women  waiting longer  have children  never taking that step  .

The  statistic    with fertility rates  western European countries, according  World Bank data.

Alarmed  recent drops,  Trump administration  taken steps  increase falling birth rates, like issuing  executive order meant  expand access   reduce costs   vitro fertilization  backing  idea  “baby bonuses” that might encourage more couples  have kids.

But there'  reason   alarmed, according  Leslie Root,  University  Colorado Boulder researcher focused  fertility  population policy.

“We’ seeing this  part   ongoing process  fertility delay. We know that  U.S. population  still growing,   still have  natural increase — more births than deaths,”  said.

The U.S. Centers  Disease Control  Prevention released  statistic   total fertility rate with updated birth data  2024.

In  early 1960s,  U.S. total fertility rate  around 3.5,  plummeted  1.7  1976 after  Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose  2.1  2007 before falling again, aside from  2014 uptick. The rate  2023  1.621,  inched down  2024  1.599, according   CDC' National Center  Health Statistics.

Birth rates  generally declining  women  most  groups —  that doesn’ seem likely  change   near future, said Karen Guzzo, director   Carolina Population Center   University  North Carolina.

People  marrying later  also worried about their ability  have  money, health insurance  other resources needed  raise children   stable environment.

“Worry    good moment  have kids,”  that’  birth rates  most  groups   improving,  said.

Asked about birth-promoting measures outlined   Trump administration, Guzzo said they ’ tackle larger needs like parental leave  affordable child care.

“The things that they  doing  really symbolic   likely  budge things  real Americans,”  said.

The CDC'  report, which  based   more complete review  birth certificates than provisional data released earlier this year, also showed  1% increase  births — about 33,000 more — last year compared   prior year.

That brought  yearly national total  just over 3.6 million babies born.

But this  different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year  women  their late 20s  30s. However,   report found birth rate declines  women  their 20s  early 30s,   change  women  their late 30s.

What happened? CDC officials said     recalculations stemming from  change   U.S. Census population estimates used  compute  birth rate.

That' plausible, Root said. As  total population  women  childbearing  grew   immigration,  offset small increases  births  women  those  groups,  said.

WASHINGTON -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton   wife, Angela,  longtime owners   $1.5 million house   gated community outside Dallas. In 2015, they snapped   second home  Austin. Then another.

The problem: Mortgages signed   Paxtons contained inaccurate statements declaring that each  those three houses  their primary residence, enabling  -estranged couple  improperly lock   interest rates, according   Associated Press review  public records. The lower rates will save  Paxtons tens  thousands  dollars  payments over  life   loan, legal experts .

The records also revealed that  Paxtons collected  impermissible homestead  break    those homes,  they have routinely flouted lending agreements  some  their other properties.

It   federal  state crime  knowingly make false statements  mortgage documents. It' also against    Texas  collect  homestead  break   separate properties. Violating  terms   mortgage could allow lenders recourse  seek full payment   loan, according  legal experts.

The mortgage revelations  likely  become fodder   Republican primary   U.S. Senate seat  which Paxton  seeking  topple  incumbent, John Cornyn. The situation  further complicated   Trump administration' criminal pursuit  Democrats over similar issues.

President Donald Trump  accused    political foes — Sen. Adam Schiff  California  New York Attorney General Letitia James —  committing mortgage fraud, though legal experts   circumstances  less serious.

The Democrats have long been objects  Trump’   having  various investigations into  conduct  president    business executive.

Paxton, himself,  weighed    investigation  James, saying  hoped authorities would look into  conduct. “I hope that  ’ done something wrong, I hope that ’ actually held accountable,”  told supporters last month.

The Justice Department  launched  criminal investigation  James, FBI director Kash Patel told Fox News  May. The department received  criminal referral  Schiff last week from  Federal Housing Finance Agency,  director William Pulte confirmed   social media post.

Neither  Justice Department   FHFA responded   inquiry about whether they  investigate Paxton, .

James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, urged  Trump administration  investigate Paxton instead.

“If this administration  genuinely interested  rooting  fraud,  appears they should stop wasting their time   baseless  discredited allegations against  New York Attorney General James  turn their attention  Texas,” said Lowell,  prominent Washington attorney whose past clients include Hunter Biden, Ivanka Trump  Jared Kushner.

In  statement, Marisol Samayoa,  Schiff spokeswoman, blasted  criminal referral  “ transparent attempt”  Trump “ punish  perceived political    committed  holding   account.” She added that Schiff disclosed   lenders that  owned another home that   principal residence  sought guidance from  attorney.

It  unlikely that Paxton,  staunch Trump ally, will face  same federal scrutiny  James  Schiff. It’ equally doubtful that Paxton will face much legal trouble  Texas: His office     primary agencies tasked with investigating allegations  mortgage fraud.

Ken Paxton   spokesman   respond  multiple requests  comment. Angela Paxton,    state senator  Texas,   respond  requests made through  office.

Documents reviewed   AP show  Paxtons hold mortgages  three homes —   suburban Dallas,   Austin — that  each listed  their primary residence. The designation comes with  considerable financial upside.

Interest rates  primary homes  significantly lower than those  mortgages  secondary homes  investment properties, saving buyers tens  thousands  dollars —   more — over  life   loan.

Making  case against Paxton would require "establishing both that Paxton  aware   contents   mortgage document,  also that   actively aware   time that  signed  that this   going    primary residence,” said Jennifer E. Laurin,  professor   University  Texas Law School  Austin.

Legal experts    possible that  Paxtons’ lenders prepared  documents  that  couple   carefully review them before signing.

Even  that were  case, some legal experts  that Paxton,   attorney  Texas’   enforcement officer, ought  have known better.

“If  filled  lender documents knowing that they were false, then that   false statement  obtain  mortgage  favorable terms. That would  actionable,” said Arif Lawji,  veteran Texas real estate attorney. “He’  chief enforcement officer. You have   accountable  stuff   that’ wrong.”

Low interest rates    only perk  Paxtons secured, records show. In 2018, they simultaneously collected homestead property  breaks  their family’ home  suburban Dallas,  well    $1.1 million home  Austin, property records   statements show.

A homestead  break   property  reduction that  homeowner  only eligible  collect   property that  also their primary home.

The suburban Dallas home  where  Paxtons’ family  long resided. It’ where Ken  Angela Paxton  registered  vote. It  located   state Senate district that Angela Paxton represents   Legislature, which Ken Paxton held before  election  2014   attorney general. It’ also where Ken Paxton’ Senate campaign website until recently said  lived.

Lawji said  Paxtons’ simultaneous collection   homestead  breaks appears    more clearcut violation. That  because  must obtain  form  submit   taxing authorities  receive such   break, making   “intentional ,”  said.

The  break  worth several thousand dollars,  fact that confounded real estate lawyers. “Why would       this,” Lawji said, “when    attorney general? That’  bigger question   than  money, when   AG  have  enforce this .”

Separately, land records indicate  Paxtons  have violated  terms   least  mortgages  other houses they . The mortgage   home  College Station, Texas, says  property    Paxtons’ exclusive   cannot  rented . Doing  would  grounds  terminating  mortgage,  document states. The home  been listed  rent  real estate websites -- since  least 2022.

Ken Paxton also holds  $1.2 million mortgage   “5 bedroom luxury cabin”  Broken Bow, Oklahoma, that   rent  Airbnb  other short-term rental sites, records show. The property’ mortgage stipulates that  cannot  rented .

Representatives  Stifel Bank, Cornerstone Home Lending  Benchmark Mortgage, which issued  mortgages  question,   respond  requests  comment.

Paxton’ real estate dealings   many ways distinct from those  James  Schiff,  Democrats targeted   Trump administration.

The investigation  James centers  forms  signed  2023 while helping  niece   home  Virginia. One form stated that James intended  occupy  home   “principal residence.” But  other documents,  New York attorney general made clear    intention  living there. An email   mortgage loan broker  weeks before  signed  documents stated  property “WILL NOT   primary residence.”

“As I’ said from  beginning,  prosecutors want  know that truth about Attorney General James’ mortgage applications,   ready  waiting with  facts,” said Lowell, James’ attorney.

For over  decade, Schiff owned homes  Maryland  California,  state  represents, that were both designated   primary residence. In 2020, then  congressman, Schiff designated  Maryland property   second home —  step Paxton   taken.

Paxton’ real estate dealings    first time   drawn scrutiny   conduct while  office.

Before  election  attorney general, Paxton, then  state senator, admitted  2014  violating Texas securities   paid  fine.

He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment  securities charges while serving  attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped  2024. Other alleged misdeeds  office    impeachment  Texas’ GOP-controlled House  2023. He  acquitted   trial   Senate.

Angela Paxton   cast  vote   impeachment trial  recently filed  divorce, citing Ken Paxton’ infidelity  other “recent discoveries.” She   elaborate.

What ultimately unleashed  impeachment push  Paxton’ relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul,  pleaded guilty this year   count  making  false statement   financial institution.

In 2020, eight  aides  Paxton’ office told  FBI they were concerned  state’   enforcement official  misusing  office  help Paul over  developer’ unproven claims about  elaborate conspiracy  steal $200 million   properties.

The House impeachment managers accused Paxton  attempting  interfere  foreclosure lawsuits  issuing legal opinions  benefit Paul. They also alleged that Paul employed  woman with whom Paxton   affair  exchange  legal help  that  developer paid  expensive renovations   attorney general’ home  Austin.

That would   same house that  declared  mortgage documents   third primary residence.

As higher education costs have grown  heights many U.S. residents find unattainable  illogical, some adults  looking  their employers  help

NEW YORK -- After five years  working long nights   truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted  change. He found driving unfulfilling,   teenage  needed   spend more time  home.

So Mosley took     customer service representative   telecommunications company near  home. The employee benefits included being able  take -related classes  free. He decided  wanted  study leadership   could learn about managing teams  helping people become  best versions  themselves.

His company, Spectrum, paid   10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went   complete. Then  covered  tuition cost   bachelor' degree  leadership  organization studies that ' currently pursuing. The company also promoted    management position while  took college courses online.

“It’ completely changed  course   life,” Mosley said about  education benefit, which took care   tuition  front instead  requiring     seek later reimbursement. “It’ truly  blessing   able   this.”

As higher education costs have grown  heights many U.S. residents find unattainable  illogical, some adults  looking  their employers  help defraying  expense  college  professional credentials. Nearly half  public  private employers have  tuition reimbursement program  employees, according   Society  Human Resource Management,  SHRM.

Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members   $5,250  year because that amount  -deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO   Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials  HR professionals.

Some companies offer more, including Bank  America, which provides tuition assistance    $7,500 annually,  Spectrum which,  addition   prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master' degrees  enrolled  classes that fall outside  scope   prepaid program   $10,000  year.

"For companies   looking  attract Generation Z  Millennials, ’  great   bring them  because they’ keenly interested   companies  investing  them   benefits that  available," said Dufrane.

Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8%  employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according  James Atkinson, vice president  thought leadership  SHRM.

If continuing education feels   reach financially  seems incompatible with  demands, experts  there  ways  explore  possibility, either   making  case  your employer  seeking  position   place that provides education benefits.

In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees   thousands  dollars    tuition, books  fees   start   semester,  usually must complete  course with  passing grade before  company would kick   contribution.

That means employees would often wait four   months before being reimbursed, which only works  more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer  Spectrum.

“The person that  afford     their credit card   with $3-  $4-  $5,000  expenses  back  them    concerned about that cost, that    average worker,” Marchand said. “Our average worker  making $25, $28, $30 bucks  hour, maybe having  second , maybe  single parent with kids, ...  they’ important workers  ,   want  help develop them  grow their careers.”

Spectrum launched  program that lets employees sign    array  certificates  college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses  where  take them came from Guild,  Denver company that works with employers  workforce development  tuition assistance.

Walmart offers  similar benefit   front-line associates,   enroll  college  certain classes without ever seeing  invoice, according  company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends  family members   employees,  said.

As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs  well  tuition assistance.

Morgan Woods, 29,  training analyst  semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries, graduated from college with  $20,000 debt load. Her employer  paying $125  month toward  student loans,   that will increase over time.

Woods  expects     loans four years earlier than  anticipated doing     hopes  will improve  options   explores buying  house.

“The fact that I’  ahead  where I thought I would   little over  year   very nice  ,”  said.

Not  employers offer education benefits,  when they , they'  always widely publicized. To find   your employer offers such benefits,   manager   human resources representative.

Show   course  training directly relates  your role    would help   your  more effectively, Dufrane advised. Even  there'  formal tuition reimbursement program, your employer might have  training  professional development budget.

“If ’ taking   stretch role  entering   industry,   advocate  training  part  your offer. Say something like, ‘I’ like  take  course  help     speed  this area.’ In  experience, that shows initiative  employers often respect ,” Dufrane said.

You  also approach your boss  , “I want  move   I want  invest  myself. What recommendations   have  ?” Dufrane added.

Fitting  classes, study sessions  paper writing   daunting when holding down  full-time ,  there  ways  make  work.

Rene Sotolongo,  cybersecurity analyst   Human Resource Certification Institute, earned  master' degree  cybersecurity using tuition reimbursement benefits from  employer. To manage  time,  switched  working Monday through Thursday, studied  weeknights  dedicated Friday through Sunday  other schoolwork.

“Without  tuition reimbursement   organization’ flexibility, there’   that I would  able ” earn advanced degrees, said Sotolongo,    pursuing  PhD with assistance from HRCI. “It’ rewarding  every aspect.”

Providing flexibility shows commitment  employees, Dufrane said. “You’    flexible around learning because people have parents they’ taking care   kids they' taking care ,  going home  night ’ always  best time   writing  paper,”  said.

Fitting  schoolwork while also meeting  needs   ,  fiancee,  full-time    puppy  been challenging  Mosley,   also provided    model studious behavior   .

“Instead   just telling   needs   ,  ’ seeing  doing schoolwork,  that actually helped  with  wanting    work more," Mosley said. "We actually take time   down together some days  work   homework,  ’ been  life-changing situation.”

WASHINGTON -- U.S. automakers worry that President Donald Trump' agreement  tariff Japanese vehicles  15% would  them   competitive disadvantage, saying they will face steeper import taxes  steel, aluminum  parts than their competitors.

“We need  review   details   agreement,  this   deal that will charge lower tariffs  Japanese autos with  U.S. content,” said Matt Blunt, president   American Automotive Policy Council, which represents  Big 3 American automakers, General Motors, Ford  Jeep-maker Stellantis.

Blunt said   interview  U.S. companies  workers “definitely    disadvantage” because they face  50% tariff  steel  aluminum   25% tariff  parts  finished vehicles, with some exceptions  products covered under  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that went into effect  2020.

The domestic automaker reaction reveals  challenge  enforcing policies across  world economy, showing that    Trump’ promises there   genuine tradeoffs from policy choices that risk serious blowback  politically important states such  Michigan  Wisconsin, where automaking  both  source  income   identity.

The United Auto Workers said   statement   “deeply angered”   deal. “A better deal would have held Japanese automakers   same standards U.S. workers have fought   GM, Ford,  Stellantis,”  UAW said.

“If this becomes  blueprint  trade with Europe  South Korea,  will   major missed opportunity,”  union added. “We need trade deals that raise standards —  reward  race   bottom. This deal does  opposite.”

Trump portrayed  trade framework   major  after announcing   Tuesday, saying  would  hundreds  thousands  jobs   U.S. economy  open  Japanese economy  ways that could close  persistent trade imbalance. The agreement includes  15% tariff that replaces  25% import   Republican president  threatened  charge starting  Aug. 1. Japan would also  together $550 billion  invest  U.S. projects   “direction”   president,  White House said.

The framework with Japan will remove regulations that prevent American vehicles from being sold  that country,  White House  said, adding that  would  possible  vehicles built  Detroit   shipped directly  Japan  ready   sold.

But Blunt said that foreign auto producers, including  U.S., Europe  South Korea, have just  6% share  Japan, raising skepticism that simply having  open market that  Trump administration says will exist  that country will  sufficient.

“Tough   crack,  I’  very surprised     meaningful market penetration  Japan,” Blunt said.

Asked  Wednesday' briefing about whether Trump' sectoral tariffs such  those  autos were  subject  possible change, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that  issue  been going through  Commerce Department.

The framework with Japan  also  indication that some nations simply    preferential  have   tariff rate rather than  whipsawed  Trump' changes  import taxes since April. But   moment, both Japan   United Kingdom with  quotas  auto exports might enjoy  competitive edge   U.S.

“With this agreement  place  provides Japan with  near-term operating cost advantage compared  other foreign automakers,  even some domestic U.S. product that uses  high degree  both foreign production  parts content,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst  iSeeCars. "It will  interesting    this   first domino  fall   series  foreign countries that decide long-term stability  more important that short term disputes over specific tariff rates.”

Autos Drive America,  organization that represents major Japanese companies Toyota, Honda  Nissan  other international automakers, said   statement that   “encouraged”   announced trade framework  noted  members have exceeded domestic automaker production   past  years.

The statement urged " Trump administration  swiftly reach similar agreements with other allies  partners, especially  European Union, South Korea, Canada  Mexico.”

The Japanese framework could give automakers  other countries grounds  pushing  changes   Trump administration' tariffs regime. The president  previously said that  values flexibility  negotiating import taxes. The USMCA    review next year.

Ford, GM  Stellantis  “have every right   upset,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president  consultancy AutoForecast Solutions. But “Honda, Toyota,  Nissan still import vehicles from Mexico  Canada, where  current levels  tariffs   higher than those applied  Japanese imports. Most   high-volume models from Japanese brands  already produced  North America.”

Fiorani noted that among   exceptions   Toyota 4Runner,  Mazda CX-5   Subaru Forester,  most   other imports fill niches that   small  warrant production   U.S.

“There will  negotiations between  U.S.  Canada  Mexico,   will probably result  tariffs  higher than 15%,” Fiorani added, “ nobody seems     hurry  negotiate around  last Trump administration’ free trade agreement.”

Europe: Monday-Friday, 0500-06:00 CET The  story Thirty-seven-year- Indian national KM  three months away from calling Dubai  second home. The start- founder —  recently amassed nearly 100 million Indian rupees ($1.16 million)  assets  crossed  high--worth threshold —  relocating from India' financial capital, Mumbai,  enjoy lower taxes   better lifestyle. The start- founder,  only wished   identified   initials   privacy concerns,  among  sizable number  wealthy Indians looking  relocate from  South Asian powerhouse. While there   fixed definition   qualifies  "rich,"  widely accepted threshold  individuals   high--worth bracket  50  250 million Indian rupees, while those whose wealth exceeds 250 million Indian rupees  considered ultra-high--worth. Affluent individuals  those with   worth between 10 million  50 million Indian rupees. India  home  85,698 individuals with assets exceeding $10 million, according   recent report from Knight Frank. That accounts  3.7%   global population with that  worth, more than  U.K.' 2.4%,  less than China' 20.1%. With India' booming economy poised  overtake Japan  become  world' fourth largest,   time  strong market returns, I  puzzled  KM' decision  relocate. KM told  that    "instinctive decision." "India' economy  booming   large consumer pool  beneficial   company. So, I will keep    business headquarters,  I feel Dubai   better place  live ,"  said. KM previously considered relocating  either Singapore, Portugal  Spain,  settled  Dubai because   "-free structures, good education system, global diaspora  proximity  Mumbai."

Strategic,  permanent relocation

A recent survey  wealth management firm Kotak Private, conducted  association with consultancy EY, revealed that   five   150 ultra-high--worth individuals polled plan  emigrate from India while retaining their Indian citizenship. Such  phenomenon comes  wealthy Indians  considering other residencies  strategic purposes, rather than  permanent relocation, Himanshu Kohli, -founder  multi-family office Client Associates, told . "Their decisions  typically driven  long-term generational thinking rather than dissatisfaction towards India,"  said. "This ' about abandoning India — ' about expanding ' footprint  ensuring families have global options   increasingly interconnected world," Kohli noted, adding that many remain invested  India through start-  real estate. Besides  United Arab Emirates, several countries such  Singapore, Portugal,  U.K.   U.S. have rolled  attractive initiatives  attract  wealthy. These include significantly lower  rates, which  more favorable than India'. For instance,  UAE  zero taxes  personal income, capital gains  inheritance. By contrast, India employs  progressive income  structure, where individuals earning around 1.2 million Indian rupees  slapped with  15% , which increases with their income bracket. Meanwhile,  country   12.5%   most long-term capital gains. India' higher  structure compared  other countries     perception that  wealthy  emigrating  avoid taxes. That, however, "   whole story," Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta, CEO  Wrise Wealth Management Middle East, tells . "India, still views wealth within domestic constraints,"  said. By this,  means that India' policies focus  domestic wealth management rather than building strategies with global exposure. And , Sengupta argues that India' wealthy "  fleeing taxes. They' buying freedom, mobility, peace  mind   ability  plan   future. As  next generation  coming , they want options." He also flagged regulatory challenges  wealth  legacy planning,  well  social concerns such  traffic congestion  metropolises, pollution,  infrastructure gaps,  other pressing issues prompting migration.

Not  unique problem

India' wealth drain   unique   country. While  reasons  relocating  differ,  issue remains  perennial challenge, especially  developing economies,   undermines investor confidence  long-term growth. The movement  wealth  affect  creation  innovation. A loss   revenues  also affect state coffers, while large capital outflows  even weaken  local currency. India  expected  lose about 3,500 millionaires this year,  Henley Private Migration Report forecasted. The estimates  based  individuals  reside  their  country  over  months  excluded those  acquire residency rights  ' relocate. Although India  among   countries  millionaire emigration,  number  projected departures  declined  absolute terms over  past  years, data from Henley shows.

This  thanks  large part  more people staying   accumulate wealth  capture  country' exponential growth, Neil Bahal, founder  investment firm Negen Capital, told . "India  facing strong consumption from  large population,  many millionaires want exposure  that. It' only those    their retirement phase  looking  expand their businesses overseas   moving abroad,"  noted. Bahal  also confident that India will   increase   return   wealthy   coming years, given  country' exponential growth. As  stands, many remain bullish  India  allocate around 60%  65%  their investments domestically, hoping  reap multi-fold returns.

What  needed?

Whether  emigration  wealthy Indians will slow  pick  steam  hard  predict. But what  critical  New Delhi   make systemic shifts that make   attractive place  live  invest . For instance, political analyst Sanjay Baru highlighted  urgent need  deregulate    -called "regulation ,"   excessive bureaucratic control over businesses." The bureaucracy  India remains  challenge," Baru,    former spokesperson   late Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, told CNBC' Inside India, adding that  country also needs  look  facilitating  ease  doing business. On  social level, Sunaina Kumar,  senior fellow   think tank Observer Research Foundation, suggests that  government continue  invest  urban planning  build better infrastructure  reduce  "gridlock"  major cities. This would make them more livable  attractive  settle down ,  said. Kumar also suggested that  government explore ways  intentionally engage with  wealthy  remain  India,  well  those  have emigrated. This could  achieved  creating pathways  offer monetary contributions  philanthropic  social impact programs. Another option   business owners  create jobs  Indians  entities both locally  abroad, Kumar said. While these improvements  help address some   systemic issues  India, they will take time  execute. If successful, India  eventually become another wealth  like  UAE  Switzerland —  that keeps  wealthy individuals  spurs  return  those like KM. "Wealth-friendly policies  better living standards will move  needle  India.

Millions  people living  mobile home parks ' enjoy  same drinking water protections that Americans  accustomed 

The worst water Colt Smith  seen  14 years with Utah’ Division  Drinking Water    mobile home park, where residents  been drinking   years before state officials discovered  contamination.

The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic  much  10 times  federal limit. Smith     rural park under  --drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.

“The Health Department refers    like ... ‘Why aren’  guys regulating ?’ We   idea  existed,”  said.

More than 50 years after  Safe Drinking Water Act  passed  ensure that Americans’ water  free from harmful bacteria, lead  other dangerous substances, millions  people living  mobile home parks ’ always count  those basic protections.

A review  The Associated Press found that nearly 70%  mobile home parks running their  water systems violated safe drinking water rules   past five years,  higher rate than utilities that supply water  cities  towns, according  Environmental Protection Agency data. And  problems  likely even bigger because  EPA database doesn’ catch  parks.

Even where parks  water from  outside source — such   city —  clean water coming   become contaminated   passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because  EPA doesn’ generally require this water   tested  regulated,  problems   unseen.

Utah      states  step  with their  rules, according   AP survey  state policies.

“If  look back   history   Safe Drinking Water Act, like   ’70s when they were starting,  , ‘Well,  long   source …  protected, then   time  gets   , ’  fine.’ And that’ just    works,” Smith said.

In  Colorado mobile home park,  sewage backed  into  bathtub. In  Michigan park,  taps often     water resembled ;  Iowa,  looked like coffee — scaring residents  drinking   ruining laundry they could hardly afford  replace. In California, boxes  bottled water crowd  family' kitchen over fears  arsenic.

Almost 17 million people   U.S. live  mobile homes. Some  comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes   mobile homes   rare opportunity  home ownership.

To understand  water   parks    troubled, ’ useful  remember that residents often  their homes  rent  land they  . Despite  name, ' difficult  expensive  move  mobile home. That means they’ “halfway homeowners,” said Esther Sullivan,  professor  sociology   University  Colorado  Denver  lived  several mobile home parks   researched  book. Residents often   with “really egregious” property maintenance  landlords because  their money  tied   their home,  said.

Pamela Maxey, 51,  Kalamazoo, Michigan, said   forgotten what   like  have reliable, clean water until  traveled   state Capitol last year  advocate  better mobile home park protections  stayed   hotel. By then,   spent eight years   park where sewage backed  into homes   flow   water  sometimes weak  discolored.

“It wasn’ until I went into  bathroom  take  shower that I realized, ‘I ’ have  jump  here  squint  eyes closed  entire time  make sure water doesn’    mouth because I ’ know what’  ,’”  said. “I went  brush  teeth,  I just turned  faucet   I brushed  teeth from  water coming from  faucet. I haven’ been able   that  over  year.”

Victoria Silva,  premed student  Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates  water  Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went   lost pressure 20  30 times over roughly three years there.

“People ’ realize  much water they need until  water    five minutes when they need  flush, when they need  rinse something  their hands, when they need  make some pasta,” Silva said.

The park' owner says  licensed professional ensures water  maintained  tested,  outages  minimized.

The U.S.  some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns  rural areas. Many struggle  find expert staff  funding,  they violate clean water rules more often than  handful  large utilities that serve cities. But even among  hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand .

The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed  perform  required test   least  contaminant,  failed  properly report  results,   past five years. And they   more likely   repeat offenders  safe drinking water rules overall.

But that' only part   story. The true rates  mobile home park violations aren’ knowable because  EPA doesn’ track them well. The agency’  water violation database depends  information from states that often ’ properly categorize mobile home parks.

When Smith first searched Utah’ database  response   AP request  data from  50 states,  found only four small water systems identified  belonging  mobile home parks. With some keyword searches,  identified 33 more.

Other parks aren’   databases      completely unregulated.

One July   2021, officials with  EPA were  investigating -high arsenic levels    water  Oasis Mobile Home Park   Southern California desert when they realized  problem went  beyond just  place.

“It  literally  driving around  going, ‘Wait  minute, there’  bunch  mobile home parks!’” said Amy Miller,  previously served  EPA’ head  enforcement   Pacific Southwest region.

The water  these other parks  been  their radar. At some, testing found high levels  cancer-causing arsenic   water that  been provided  residents  years.

It’ impossible  know  many unnoticed parks   there. Most states aren’ actively looking  them   they find very . In Colorado, after  state passed     require water testing   mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source  water unknown. That’ about  tenth   total parks   state.

Many parks  decades  with aging pipes that  cause chronic water problems, even   water that supplies  park  clean when  enters  system.

Jake Freeman,  engineering director  Central States Water Resources,  Missouri-based private utility company that specializes  taking over small water systems  11 states, said substandard  poorly installed pipes  more common    mobile home parks.

“A   times, ’ hard  find  piping   mobile home parks because  there’  kind  obstruction, they just  around ,”  said. ”“It’ like spaghetti laying   ground.”

After  major winter storm devastated Texas  2021, Freeman said,  company found pipes  parks   taken over that “were barely buried. Some  them weren’ buried.”

When pipes break  leak,  pressure drops  contaminants  enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water — where pipes dead-  water sits unused — that increases  risk  bacterial growth.

Rebecca Sadosky  public water supply chief  North Carolina, where mobile home communities make  close  40%   water systems. She said owners ’ always realize when they   park that they could also  running  mini utility.

“I think they ’ know that they’ getting into  water business,”  said.

Utah   rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that  their water from another provider, according  AP’ survey  states. A small number  other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps  address water safety  these parks,   most states frustrated residents  have    turn   help beyond  park owner.

In Colorado, when Silva asked officials  enforces safe drinking water rules, “I just couldn’  clear answers.”

Steve Via, director  federal regulations   American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that  their water from  municipality, saying that would further stretch  already taxed oversight system. And  those parks  regulated, what’  stop  rules from extending   privately owned pipes   apartment buildings —  line    drawn somewhere,  said.

Via said residents  parks where  owner refuses   water problems have options, including going  their local health departments, suing  complaining publicly.

Silva  among  advocates  fought  years  change Colorado’ rules before they succeeded  passing    2023 that requires water testing  every mobile home park. It gives health officials  ability   beyond federal   address taste, color  smell that  make people afraid  drink their water, even when ’   health risk. The state    leader  protecting mobile home park  water.

Smith,  Utah environmental scientist, said stopping  contaminated water flowing into  mobile home park  connecting    safe supply felt like  career highlight.

He said Utah' culture  making  with scarce water contributed   willingness  stronger testing  regulations than  federal government requires.

“There’ sort   communal nature  like, everybody should have access  clean water,”  said. “It seems  transcend political ideologies;  seems  transcend religious ideologies.”

I think there   things: One  there'  sense  which  companies have  give  control  they' giving people more time back. Management doesn' like that. For some  these return--office mandates, they' really more about control than they  about performance.

I think  answer  that   same answer : Why   that  many companies  trying  hard   people back   office when they ' want   back,  when  companies have been really successful with work from home?

If  four- workweek   good  businesses  employees,  ' more places  ?

The pace  work didn' speed . You' think everybody just works really hard  those four days   everything . But '  company-wide work reorganization.

I thought that second -holding would  . It doesn'. In fact,  average,  falls. People really  taking that   themselves.

That productivity bump they ,  feeling  good about their work quality, that    positive impact  their overall well-being, which  never expected.

Beyond maintaining productivity, people just feel  much better. They feel    their work  their life,  they'  stressed . They feel recovered when they come  work  Monday morning. They feel more eager   work. They feel like they    done.

CNBC Make It: What   most surprising results ' seen from four- workweek trials?

Schor compiled these findings   latest book, "Four Days  Week,"  spoke with CNBC Make It about  research. Here,  covers  experiments' biggest surprises,  more companies '   shortened week, whether  could lead   cuts   AI advancements    picture.

Employees rated their work-life balance higher after shortening their weeks; they experienced less burnout, stress  anxiety,  better mental  physical health. Business profits grew  turnover disappeared.

By  summer  2024, 245 organizations  more than 8,700 employees across  U.S., Canada, Ireland,  U.K., Australia  more  piloted 4 Day Week experiments, which primarily uses  four-, 32-hour week model with  reduction  .

In recent years, Schor,  economist  sociology professor  Boston College,  been  lead researcher with 4 Day Week,  global group  business leaders  experts studying  impacts   shortened workweek  companies  their employees.

The events  2020 change everything. The Covid-19 pandemic  widespread loss  life, combined with  reimagining   people live  work,  many  realize "  more important   living  life they they wanted  lead,  that    life  overworking stress  burnout," Schor tells CNBC Make It.

It   nerve: The book landed    The New York Times' bestseller list, into rooms with -name CEOs    phone with policymakers  Washington, D.C. Then,  issue died; plans  experiment with shorter workdays  workweeks didn'  .

Juliet Schor  been studying  benefits  working less  decades. She published  first book   topic, "The Overworked American,"  1992.

Second,  feels radical  risky. That'   helps  these companies   through  -month  year-long pilot     goes. The five- week  very ingrained.

On  other hand, Friday  kind  organically evolving    that  pretty clear. There' less  less work being done  Friday. Most companies ' reorganize things  Summer Fridays, they just give people that time. You'  losing  whole ' worth  productivity, because ' already  less productive . We  evolving away from  full Friday workday. I think  need  accelerate that process.

Could  four- workweek lead companies   their employees less?

To    trials,  cannot reduce   . That'  requirement.

I ' think cutting  would work. People hate  reductions that   voluntary. Some people     trade-  working less  less money. But   most part, people have commitments   money they have   current time. Many people   economy aren' earning enough,   they' struggling  meet their needs. I think management would  very foolish  just   take money away from people, because they will hate .

The standard payment model says people should  whatever their productivity . So with this four- week where '  seeing  reduction  productivity,  shouldn' have  change  .

We also  people stop quitting four--week jobs. The resignation rates just pretty much   zero  many  these companies. That' where management could maybe take advantage  decide  give lower wage increases over time. I think that' possible  more companies  . But  countervailing trend  that  they' adopting AI that makes people   more productive. And   standard models  they should  wage increases   result.

Could AI speed   four- workweek? Could  eliminates jobs?

It' really hard  keep everyone  jobs  ' displacing labor with technology. And increasingly, economists  finding that  -killing potential  AI  really high.

We' faced with  possibilities. One : We   huge numbers  people,  I ' think ' going   able  -employ them    timely fashion. Then  have  economic catastrophe   hands.

Or: We gradually reduce hours    that  people  more productive, '  cutting employment, ' just having people spend less time  work.

If  have that productivity increase from AI,     give people more free time,  which case their income stays more  less  same. Or    toward more work  more money.

But   have  much productivity growth,  companies ' necessarily expand that much. So what    suddenly produce twice  much? Is there somebody there ' going   that twice  much? Where'  that demand going  come from?

The labor market doesn' seem favorable  workers right . Does  four- workweek really have momentum   current environment?

It'  very mixed picture    market right . For some occupations,  AI reasons  others, ' hard    . But there  others where employers  having difficulty filling positions,  they'  getting people back into  office. The latest data around hours worked  home  really steady. They  just  going down.

Of course,   have   recession, then lots  things change. But I think ' still   path toward moving  that direction.

If  look   numbers  stress, burnout, disengagement, people struggling  their jobs   forth — they were  record levels during  pandemic,  they have come down since then,    that much. And I think that creates ongoing momentum  normalize  four- week.

Is  goal  these experiments ultimately  make  four- workweek  national standard  ?

I reached    head   manufacturing company that    trials about possibly testifying  Senator Bernie Sanders' bill  amend  Fair Labor Standards Act    statutory workweek  32 hours. This person' response : I believe very much  this. It' been really great   company. But I ' believe  legislating .

Typically  need more momentum     change like this  labor , where ' seeing more  that practice across  economy. Like with Family  Medical Leave Act, many companies already  instituted  before  became  national standard. So  need more  companies  show  viable  . And then  personal view  that  need legislation  pull  laggards along.

Ten hours later, "South Park" creators Matt Stone  Trey Parker excoriated Paramount —  aggressively skewered President Donald Trump —   premiere episode   Comedy Central show' 27th season.

In  episode, Trump (voiced  Stone) sues  town  South Park  $5 billion after they push back  Jesus Christ' presence  their elementary school. The townspeople  prepared  fight back,  Jesus Christ (also voiced  Stone) urges them  settle.

"You guys  what happened  CBS? Yeah, well, guess  owns CBS? Paramount," Jesus Christ says   episode' climax. "Do  really want    like Colbert?"

Paramount  under intense scrutiny  appearing  kowtow   Trump administration ahead   proposed blockbuster merger. Stone  Parker were clearly riffing  their corporate parent' eventful summer.

On July 2, Paramount agreed   $16 million  settle  lawsuit from Trump,  alleged that CBS' "60 Minutes"  deceptively edited  interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS denied that claim.

On July 17, CBS announced that  planned  cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"  May, calling  move "purely  financial decision." But many  Colbert' fans cried foul, arguing that  comedian  being penalized   years  anti-Trump humor.

Both developments came  Paramount  preparing   sold  Skydance Media,  entertainment production  finance company headed  David Ellison,    Oracle mogul ( Trump ally) Larry Ellison. The corporate - requires federal approval.

The premiere episode, titled "Sermon   'Mount," took   other satirical targets, including  supposed death  "wokeness,"  rise  ChatGPT   debate over Christian teachings  public schools. Trump  Paramount were  focal points, however.

In  scene, "60 Minutes" reports   social unrest roiling South Park amid Trump' lawsuit. The fictional hosts   news show  visibly nervous  they introduce  segment, going   their   praise  president  " great ."

"We know ' probably watching,"    hosts says.

CBS    only network  reach  legal settlement with Trump. ABC agreed   $15 million  part   settlement with Trump  month before  took office, effectively ending  case concerning alleged defamation.

Paramount' settlement with Trump  drawn more attention, though. Colbert, three days before CBS announced     show, blasted  arrangement   "  bribe." Jon Stewart,  host  Comedy Central' "The Daily Show," also assailed  deal.

Paramount owns CBS,  venerable Hollywood movie studio,  suite  cable brands (including Comedy Central)   Paramount+ streaming platform.

"South Park"  widely known  jabbing politicians  social trends across  ideological spectrum. But  latest episode' depiction  Trump arguably went further than usual.

Stone  Parker depict Trump   petulant child, recycling  animation style they used  Saddam Hussein   1999 film "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut." They also make profane references   president' anatomy.

"Sermon   'Mount" closes with  apparently AI-generated video  Trump wandering   desert  removing  clothes.

“In  fluid  turbulent international situation today,   crucial that  countries, notably  major economies, maintain policy continuity  stability  step  efforts  address climate change,”  joint statement said.

They highlighted trade  their opening remarks, calling  concrete progress  address Europe’ yawning trade deficit with China.

“As  cooperation  deepened,  have  imbalances,” European Commission President Ursula   Leyen said. “We have reached  inflection point. Rebalancing  bilateral relation  essential. Because   sustainable, relations need   mutually beneficial.”

Little movement expected

Expectations were  ahead   talks, initially supposed  last  days  scaled back  . They come amid financial uncertainty around  world, wars   Middle East  Ukraine,   threat  U.S. tariffs. Neither  EU  China  likely  budge   issues.

European Council President António Costa called  China    influence over Russia  bring       Ukraine —  long-running plea from European leaders that  likely  fall again  deaf ears.

Xi called  deeper cooperation between China  Europe  provide stability   increasingly complex world. Both sides should  aside differences  seek common ground,  said,  phrase  often uses  relationships like   with  EU.

“We hope  EU will keep  trade  investment markets open, refrain from using restrictive economic  trade tools  provide  good business environment  Chinese companies  invest  develop  Europe,”  said, according   readout posted online  state broadcaster CCTV.

Besides trade   Ukraine ,   Leyen  Costa were expected  raise concerns about Chinese cyberattacks  espionage,  restrictions   export  rare earth minerals   human rights record  Tibet, Hong Kong  Xinjiang.

The EU, meanwhile,  concerns about  looming trade battle with  United States.

“Europe  being very careful   antagonize President Trump even further  looking maybe  close  China,    that doesn’ make this summit easier,” said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist   European Policy Center. “It will  very hard  achieve something concrete.”

China’ stance  hardened   EU, despite   olive branches, like  suspension  sanctions  European lawmakers  criticized Beijing’ human rights record  Xinjiang province, where   accused   widespread campaign  repression against  Uyghurs.

The summit ended with almost  movement   major issues  trade, electric vehicles,  Russia, said Noah Barkin,  analyst   Rhodium Group think tank. Rather, frustration from  EU  glaringly obvious “after years  which  concerns have been largely ignored  Beijing.”

He said  Europeans will likely  more “trade defense tools   months ahead, including  debate over expanding safeguards   cases under  bloc’ foreign subsidies regulation.”

Trade disputes range from rare earths  EVs

Like  U.S.,  27-nation EU bloc runs  massive trade deficit with China — around 300 billion euros ($350 billion) last year. It relies heavily  China  critical minerals   magnets made from them  cars  appliances. When China curtailed  export  those products  response  Trump’ tariffs, European automakers cried foul.

China agreed during  summit   start “ upgraded export supply mechanism”  fast-track exports  critical minerals,   Leyen said. Details   arrangement were  immediately made public. Barkin said  doubted  mechanism would  “ miracle solution  what  become  - coercion tool  Beijing   years ahead.”

The EU looks beyond Beijing  Washington

Buffeted between  combative Washington   hardline Beijing,  EU  more publicly sought  alliances elsewhere, inking  trade pact with Indonesia  drafting trade deals with South America  Mexico.

In 2021, future vice president JD Vance delivered  speech titled “The Universities Are  Enemy.” A  years later, during  campaign, Donald Trump called college leaders “Marxist maniacs.”

Now their administration  using  full force   federal government  investigate long-standing conservative complaints about universities, making sweeping demands  cutting billions  dollars  federal funding   works  bring campuses  heel.

The most powerful vehicle   onslaught  been  Joint Task Force  Combat Anti-Semitism, which recorded what  White House cast   significant victory Wednesday with  sweeping agreement with Columbia University.

The administration established  task force  February  counter what  describes  widespread failure  universities  protect Jewish students since  start  campus protests against  Israel-Gaza . In reality, many   task force’ unprecedented demands  punishments have nothing   with antisemitism. Instead, they seek hiring  programming changes  strip long-standing conservative targets including DEI   liberal worldview from higher education.

The agreement with Columbia includes provisions that deal with race,  well  others meant  combat antisemitism. Under  deal, Columbia promised   sponsor  programs that promote “unlawful DEI goals”    consider race  hiring  admissions.

A White House official,    authorized  speak publicly  spoke   condition  anonymity, said  task force began  focusing  antisemitism  described antisemitism  only “ symptom”   broken  corrupt culture  college campuses “   disease.” The official said  same campus culture that labels Jews  oppressors also isolates White students  favor  promoting racial minorities. That assertion  echoed  several administration officials  some conservative Jewish leaders.

The administration’ critics, including some Jewish leaders  groups,  stripping diversity, equity  inclusion initiatives from colleges ’ prevent antisemitism  predict  task force’ tactics will prompt  backlash. The administration  using antisemitism investigations   pretext  pursue  unrelated conservative agenda, they argue.

“It’ self-evident ’  about antisemitism,” said Yehuda Kurtzer, president   Shalom Hartman Institute,  Jerusalem-based research  educational center focused  world Jewish life  pluralism. “Why would that have anything   with cutting funding  research? It’ about conservative fears  higher education,  antisemitism   excuse.”

This account   antisemitism task force’ mission  tactics  based  interviews with 40 administration officials, administration allies, university officials  others familiar with  task force’ work. Some spoke   condition  anonymity  avoid retribution  speaking without authorization.

White House spokesman Harrison Fields said fighting antisemitism  DEI  both administration priorities.

“The suggestion that  Administration  weaponizing  fight against antisemitism  implement commonsense policies   DEI  outrageous  baseless,”  said   statement.

He said both efforts  “fully aligned with upholding federal , which these practices clearly violate.”

From antisemitism  DEI

For supporters, DEI     ensure that  types  people — regardless  race, gender  other factors —  represented  feel included  that institutions address structural barriers that  prevent equal opportunity. But critics — including many conservatives —  DEI divides people based  identity, leads  discrimination based  race  gender  ignores merit  favor  quotas.

Skip    carousel Timeline: The battle against antisemitism  college campuses arrow left arrow right For years, Republicans have complained that elite colleges  universities  hostile  conservative thought. Now  Trump administration  acting  those complaints with  unprecedented series  demands  punishments. November 2021 “If    want    things that  want     country   people  live  ,  have  honestly  aggressively attack  universities  this country.” — JD Vance   speech  candidate  US Senate July 2024 “The time  come  reclaim  once great educational institutions from  radical Left,   will  that.” — Trump campaign video February 2025 “Pursuant  President Trump’ Executive Order  Additional Measures  Combat Anti-Semitism,  Justice Department announced today  formation   multi-agency Task Force  Combat Anti-Semitism. The Task Force’ first priority will   root  anti-Semitic harassment  schools   college campuses.” — Department  Justice announces antisemitism task force March 2025 “Deliver  plan  comprehensive admissions reform. The plan must include  strategy  reform undergraduate admissions, international recruiting,  graduate admissions practices  conform with federal   policy.” — Task force letter  Columbia April 2025 “By August 2025,  University shall commission  external party, which shall satisfy  federal government    competence  good faith,  audit  student body, faculty, staff,  leadership  viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field,  teaching unit must  individually viewpoint diverse.” — Task force letter  Harvard May 2025 “The Harvard Corporation …    strongly left-leaning Obama political appointee Penny Pritzker,  Democratic operative,   catastrophic  running  institution   totally chaotic … under  leadership, Harvard  become  `political advocacy organization   party.’” — Secretary  Education Linda McMahon letter  Harvard 1 / 7 End  carousel

One task force member said  makes sense  create  “global settlement” with universities that would encompass  range  alleged violations. Task force investigations sometimes start  examining allegations  antisemitism, this person said,  then identify what members   other concerns, such  race-conscious admissions, which  Supreme Court  ruled  unconstitutional.

Now, even  Harvard fights  Trump administration  court,  administration’ hard-edged approach  paying dividends, with schools including Harvard  Columbia —   biggest targets — agreeing  some government demands.

In interviews, several administration officials argued that antisemitism  DEI  inextricably linked  said  task force’ mandate  widely understood internally  include both issues. They argued that both  rooted  racism  that both violate civil rights .

“History  shown that antisemitism  oftentimes  canary   coal mine  deeper civil rights issues,” said Josh Gruenbaum,  Trump appointee   commissioner   General Services Administration’ Federal Acquisition Service   member   task force. At  White House meeting,  senior Justice Department official compared  people behind campus antisemitism  protesters  liberal movements such  Black Lives Matter  Occupy Wall Street, attendees said.

After Hamas attacked Israel  Oct. 7, 2023,  Israel responded with  deadly incursion into Gaza, large-scale -Palestinian protests erupted  many college campuses. Some Jewish students said certain actions  rhetoric amounted  antisemitism,  colleges faced  challenge balancing  free speech rights  protesters against those concerns.

Protests were particularly intense  divisive   2023-2024 school year,  some Jewish students reported being frightened   language demonstrators used  being excluded from clubs  campus. While many protests were peaceful, some demonstrators celebrated  Oct. 7 attack, handed  fliers promoting Hamas,  spray-painted target symbols  death threats. At Columbia,  class about Israel  disrupted  protesters,  protest encampments barred “Zionists” from entering,   Jewish student just outside  school gates reported being punched   face.

A survey last fall   American Jewish Committee  current  recent Jewish college students found about 1  3 reported experiencing antisemitism during their time   student,  nearly  many said they felt uncomfortable  unsafe   campus event  least once because  their Jewish identity.

Soon after taking office,  Trump administration ordered schools  adopt stronger policies  protests  enforce them,  masks  campus,  change academic programs that deal with  Middle East.

But  task force also demanded  wide range  changes related  DEI  race. Among them: changes  admissions, closing DEI offices  altering hiring practices.

To push colleges  comply,  administration  frozen billions  dollars  federal funding   least  highly selective universities — notably Harvard  Columbia, which have seen  highest-profile federal cuts —  also Cornell, Northwestern, Brown  Princeton.

Officials also wrote  60 schools  March  warn that they might  subject  “enforcement actions” based  their responses  antisemitism, though more than 20  them have heard nothing from  administration since then, according   Washington Post survey.

One targeted school, Brown University, said  funding   without “ formal notification  explanation” from  federal government  “ spite  Brown’ cooperation with multiple government reviews   compliance with  .”

This mishmash  enforcement  frightened universities across  country. Government attorneys  using well-established processes  investigate some complaints against universities. But  other cases, political appointees  directing  announcing punishments  demands before schools have  chance  respond   allegations  before  administration attempts  negotiate  agreement,  civil rights  directs.

Some penalties  being challenged  court. But Columbia  agreed   number  changes demanded   administration.

At Harvard, talks  ongoing about creating  “pluralism ”  promote viewpoint diversity —  response   conservative critique  overly liberal faculties. In April, Harvard renamed  Office  Equity, Diversity, Inclusion  Belonging;    called Community  Campus Life.

Other universities  also making changes  line with administration priorities, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.

“What ’ seen, since  really began this effort,  know,   kind   hard hammer  first,”  said   event  June hosted  Bloomberg News. “And  ’  seen    other universities   starting  look  their practices  their programs  getting ahead   curve  that they  report back.”

A task force unlike  other

The task force  created  Feb. 3, days after Trump signed  executive order directing “additional measures  combat antisemitism.” Operated    Justice Department,  members ultimately report   White House,  White House official said, with Deputy Chief  Staff Stephen Miller playing  oversight role.

Terrell posts  social media throughout  , echoing some   right’ most incendiary  baseless claims. He also rails against diversity, equity  inclusion, often simply posting “I hate DEI”  tagging people  color with whom  disagrees  DEI hires.

He’ also echoed antisemitic comments, such  when  shared  post  X   then-head  Identity Evropa, which later changed  name  American Identity Movement,  -defunct group that  Anti-Defamation League dubbed  white-supremacist organization. The post suggested that Trump “revoke” Sen. Charles E. Schumer’ “Jew card” because   views   conflict  Israel.

He  been eager   down with conservative Jewish leaders, people  have  with  said. But  hasn’  with groups that represent larger shares   Jewish community, such   Union  Reform Judaism,  association representing  largest Jewish denomination   U.S.,  group said.

The Education  Justice departments have long been involved  enforcing civil rights laws  campuses. Involving HHS  GSA  investigations   newer approach that  given  administration  powerful stick. HHS controls many   federal grants  which universities depend. GSA,   federal government’ central procurement agency,   deep understanding  data  grants  contracts   universities across agencies.

It’   only novel strategy  task force  deploying.

Typically, government lawyers  investigators    political appointees lead  process  collecting evidence  decide whether there  cause  launch  investigation, avoiding public announcements  case there   finding  wrongdoing.

Dhillon   political team scour social media  identify instances  antisemitism  determine what investigations  launch. They often speak  post about some  those efforts publicly.

The administration  also deployed  State Department  Department  Homeland Security    prevent Harvard from enrolling foreign students,  move blocked     federal court.

And  May letter  Harvard signed   usually measured  diplomatic McMahon  written   style  Trump. It  strewn with -caps words, insults  exclamation points. “Harvard should  longer seek GRANTS from  federal government, since none will  provided,”  letter said.

Another letter, from  task force  Harvard, included  litany  demands that  little   with resolving allegations  antisemitism,  well  some that  relate. It demanded that Harvard cease alleged racial hiring  admissions preferences, shutter  DEI initiatives,  conduct  audit  assure “viewpoint diversity”   student body, faculty, staff  leadership,  well   every department, field  teaching unit.

The letter  sent  error, according   people familiar with  situation. Still, administration officials stood behind .

Harvard refused  comply,  within hours,  first funding freeze . Harvard then responded with  lawsuit.

Ignoring legal procedures

The legal basis   crackdown  universities centers  Title VI   Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination   basis  race, color  national origin  programs  activities — including universities — that receive federal funding. That includes discrimination based  shared national ancestry, such  Jewish heritage.

By ,  government  supposed  investigate complaints ,  they  substantiated, give  university  opportunity  come into compliance. Typically,  institution will negotiate  agreement, which might include policy changes  monitoring   government.

If talks fail,  government  take  case  court, where  judge would consider whether funding should  denied.

“The statutes  regulations    really careful process  government  supposed  follow,” said Shaheena Simons,  worked   civil rights attorney   Justice Department  17 years, including nine  head   educational opportunities section.

Under  ,  said, “withdrawal  federal funds  treated   last resort action.”

In several high-profile cases,  Trump task force  skipped  these steps. For instance,  announced  investigation into actions  Columbia University  March 3. Four days later,  froze $400 million  federal grants  contracts.

There  also  indication that  administration investigated Harvard before freezing about $2.5 billion  funding, declaring  university would  longer receive  future federal funding  attempting   foreign students from enrolling   school.

“The speed with which they  putting  these -called findings suggests these   bona fide investigations,” Simons said. “Legitimate investigations take time.”

McMahon defended  task force’ approach, saying  violations were obvious from news reports  -Palestinian protests against  Israel-Gaza   college campuses last year.

“If  watched  television … students really were attacked. Professors were attacked. There   action that needed   taken,”  said   Bloomberg event.

In legal filings  Harvard’ lawsuit,  Trump administration  said that    canceled contracts because  violations  civil rights  — even though officials repeatedly invoke these laws  rebuking universities. Rather,  administration said,  canceled contracts  “policy purposes,” explaining that  “policy purpose    fund institutions that fail  address antisemitism.”

The courts will decide whether   legal  pull funding without  formal investigation, negotiation  court finding, said Kenneth L. Marcus,  headed  Education Department’ civil rights office during  first Trump administration   founder  chairman   Louis D. Brandeis Center  Human Rights Under Law, which works  combat antisemitism.

Marcus welcomed  administration’ approach   overdue  aggressive response  what  sees  dangerous levels  antisemitism. But  agreed that  administration  jettisoning procedures established   that  followed when  government.

“The Trump administration  really saying they’  going    same procedures used  prior administrations because  have  exceptional circumstance here,”  said. “That   assertion that would have   litigated   courts.”

Some   administration’ threats have   materialize.

In February,  task force promised  visit 10 schools that have experienced antisemitism  meet with  wide range  people   campus community  investigate  incidents. But four  those schools said  visits have been requested. (Four universities declined  comment,     respond  requests  comment.)

George Washington University,  instance, located  mile from  White House,  publicly said  responded   notification  asking   school could prepare   visit,  school officials said they have   heard from  administration.

Many schools  unsure   status  their investigations after hearing little  nothing from  administration, said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president  government relations  national engagement   American Council  Education.

He said  reason might   gutting  staff   Education Department’ Office  Civil Rights, including closing seven  12 regional offices. Beyond that,  suggested  administration appears more interested  drawing public attention than using established procedures  investigate  prove  cases.

“What’ very, very clear  that they’  really putting  resources into  processes that  dictated  , that people understand, that lead  actual resolutions that improve  situations,” Fansmith said. “They’ putting    time  resources into things that grab attention  that they    headlines,  without  sort  follow-  implementation.”

From antisemitism   rights

The administration’ broad view   relationship between antisemitism  DEI   display   private White House meeting  Jewish leaders  early June, which followed  brutal attack  demonstrators  Boulder, Colorado,  were calling   release  Israeli hostages held  Hamas  Gaza. Top Trump administration officials including Dhillon  White House Chief  Staff Susie Wiles spoke   group.

Dhillon repeatedly connected fighting antisemitism  other conservative causes, according   people   event. She said  attack showed  Americans need expanded  rights, these people said. And  compared people guilty  antisemitism  those involved  movements including Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street  antifa, saying   ideologically aligned with Marxism.

Some guests said they took that comment  mean there  antisemitism  those movements, ,   spread  antisemitism  college campuses   natural progression. Others left confused about  task force’ true purpose.

In interviews, administration officials disagreed about whether  task force  always meant  address  wide swath  issues  whether  morphed  that direction,  they agreed that  mission extends beyond whether colleges have protected Jews  campus.

“The original version    just antisemitism,”  White House official said. “But practically,  antisemitism task force ends  folding     other conversations.”

Critics  skeptical, noting that Trump  been accused  antisemitic rhetoric himself. This month,  instance,  used  antisemitic slur while referencing unscrupulous bankers. In November 2022,   dinner with  rapper Ye, formerly known  Kanye West,   made anti-Jewish remarks,  Nick Fuentes,  antisemite  white nationalist   called Republicans  work with Jewish people “race traitors.”

Trump replied that  didn’ know  comment about bankers  considered antisemitic. As   dinner,  said   time that  “never   knew nothing about” Fuentes before  arrived with Ye   club. He wrote that Ye “expressed  anti-Semitism”   dinner.

At  congressional hearing  June, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) said Trump would  associate with antisemites    committed  eradicating anti-Jewish bias.

“Seizing control  college student admissions, faculty hiring  curricular content  colleges  universities  nothing   with protecting Jewish students,” Raskin said.

Many Jewish leaders  they  concerned about DEI programs that have divided  world into “oppressed”  “oppressors,” with Jews cast  oppressors despite antisemitism that  persisted over centuries. In  aftermath   Oct. 7 Hamas attack  Israel, some universities  “systemic blind spots” about  antisemitism that Jewish students were encountering,  DEI initiatives might have contributed, said Pamela Nadell, director   Jewish Studies Program  American University  author   forthcoming book  antisemitism.

But  said  answer   widen  definition  DEI  include Jews,   eliminate DEI.

“Ultimately, I  deeply worried that under  pretext  ending hatred  Jewish people —  historic, worldwide problem —  antisemitism task force’ demands  dismantle DEI   root  antisemitism will further isolate Jews  American colleges  universities,”  said. “Jews will  blamed   abolition. But antisemitism will  disappear from  campus.”

Three years after  Supreme Court opened  door  state abortion bans, most U.S. adults  abortion should  legal — views that look similar  before  landmark ruling.

The  findings from The Associated Press-NORC Center  Public Affairs Research poll show that about -thirds  U.S. adults think abortion should  legal    most cases.

About half believe abortion should  available  their state  someone does  want   pregnant   reason.

That level  support  abortion  down slightly from what  AP-NORC poll showed last year, when  seemed that support  legal abortion might  rising.

Laws  opinions changed when Roe  overturned

The June 2022 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe . Wade  opened  door  state bans  abortion   major policy changes.

Most states have either moved  protect abortion access  restrict . Twelve   enforcing bans  abortion  every stage  pregnancy,  four more   after about  weeks’ gestation, which  often before women realize they’ pregnant.

In  aftermath   ruling, AP-NORC polling suggested that support  legal abortion access might  increasing.

WATCH: After fall  Roe, anti-abortion activists take   birth control

Last year,  AP-NORC poll conducted  June found that 7  10 U.S. adults said  should  available    most cases,  slightly from 65%  May 2022, just before  decision that overruled  constitutional right  abortion,  57%  June 2021.

The  poll  closer  Americans’ views before  Supreme Court ruled. Now, 64%  adults support legal abortion  most   cases. More than half  adults  states with  most stringent bans   that group.

Similarly, about half   abortion should  available  their state when someone doesn’ want  continue their pregnancy   reason — about  same   June 2021  down from about 6  10  said that  2024.

Adults   strictest states  just  likely  others   abortion should  available  their state  women  want   pregnancies   reason.

Democrats support abortion access  more than Republicans . Support  legal abortion  dropped slightly among members  both parties since June 2024,  nearly 9  10 Democrats  roughly 4  10 Republicans  abortion should  legal   least most instances.

Fallout from state bans  influenced some people’ positions —   others

Seeing what’ happened   aftermath   ruling  strengthened  abortion rights position  Wilaysha White,  25-year- Ohio .

She  some regrets about  abortion   when   homeless.

“I ’ think  should  able    abortion anytime,” said White,  calls herself  “semi-Republican.”

But  said that hearing about situations — including when  Georgia woman  arrested after  miscarriage  initially charged with concealing  death —   bigger concern.

“Seeing women being sick  life  death, they’  being  first — that’ just scary,”  said. “I’ rather have   legal across  board than have that.”

Julie Reynolds’ strong anti-abortion stance  been cemented  decades  hasn’ shifted since Roe  overturned.

“It’  moral issue,” said  66-year- Arizona woman,  works part time   bank teller.

She said  view  shaped partly  having obtained  abortion herself when     20s. “I would  want  woman   through that,”  said. “I live with that every . I took  life.”

Support remains high  legal abortion  certain situations

The vast majority  U.S. adults —  least 8  10 — continue   their state should allow legal abortion   fetal abnormality would prevent  child from surviving outside  womb,   patient’ health  seriously endangered   pregnancy,    person became pregnant   result  rape  incest.

Consistent with AP-NORC’ June 2024 poll, about 7  10 U.S. adults “strongly”  “somewhat” favor protecting access  abortions  patients   experiencing miscarriages  other pregnancy-related emergencies.

In states that have banned  restricted abortion, such medical exceptions have been sharply  focus.

This   major concern  Nicole Jones,  32-year- Florida resident.

Jones   husband would like  have children soon. But  said ’ worried about access  abortion  there’  fetal abnormality   condition that would threaten  life  pregnancy since they live   state that bans most abortions after  first  weeks  gestation.

“What   needed something?”  asked. “We’ have  travel   state  risk  life because  this .”

Adults support protections  seeking abortions across state lines —    strongly

There’ less consensus  whether states that allow abortion should protect access  women  live  places with bans.

Just over half support protecting  patient’ right  obtain  abortion  another state  shielding those  provide abortions from fines  prison time. In both cases, relatively  adults — about 2  10 — oppose  measures  about 1  4  neutral.

More Americans also favor than oppose legal protections  doctors  prescribe  mail abortion pills  patients  states with bans. About 4  10 “somewhat”  “strongly” favor those protections,  roughly 3  10 oppose them.

The average rate   30-year U.S. mortgage eased this week, offering little relief  prospective homebuyers facing record-high home prices

The average rate   30-year U.S. mortgage eased this week, offering little relief  prospective homebuyers facing record-high home prices.

The long-term rate slipped  6.74% from 6.75% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ,  rate averaged 6.78%.

Borrowing costs  15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also eased. The average rate dropped  5.87% from 5.92% last week. A year ,   6.07%, Freddie Mac said.

Elevated mortgage rates have been weighing   U.S. housing market, which  been   sales slump going back  2022, when rates started  climb from  rock-bottom lows they reached during  pandemic.

NEW YORK (AP) — The fertility rate   U.S. dropped   -time   2024 with less than 1.6 kids  woman,  federal data released Thursday shows.

The U.S.  once among only   developed countries with  rate that ensured each generation  enough children  replace itself — about 2.1 kids  woman. But   been sliding  America  close   decades  more women  waiting longer  have children  never taking that step  .

The  statistic    with fertility rates  western European countries, according  World Bank data.

Alarmed  recent drops,  Trump administration  taken steps  increase falling birth rates, like issuing  executive order meant  expand access   reduce costs   vitro fertilization  backing  idea  “baby bonuses” that might encourage more couples  have kids.

But there’  reason   alarmed, according  Leslie Root,  University  Colorado Boulder researcher focused  fertility  population policy.

“We’ seeing this  part   ongoing process  fertility delay. We know that  U.S. population  still growing,   still have  natural increase — more births than deaths,”  said.

The U.S. Centers  Disease Control  Prevention released  statistic   total fertility rate with updated birth data  2024.

In  early 1960s,  U.S. total fertility rate  around 3.5,  plummeted  1.7  1976 after  Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose  2.1  2007 before falling again, aside from  2014 uptick. The rate  2023  1.621,  inched down  2024  1.599, according   CDC’ National Center  Health Statistics.

Birth rates  generally declining  women  most  groups —  that doesn’ seem likely  change   near future, said Karen Guzzo, director   Carolina Population Center   University  North Carolina.

People  marrying later  also worried about their ability  have  money, health insurance  other resources needed  raise children   stable environment.

“Worry    good moment  have kids,”  that’  birth rates  most  groups   improving,  said.

Asked about birth-promoting measures outlined   Trump administration, Guzzo said they ’ tackle larger needs like parental leave  affordable child care.

“The things that they  doing  really symbolic   likely  budge things  real Americans,”  said.

Increase  births   data

The CDC’  report, which  based   more complete review  birth certificates than provisional data released earlier this year, also showed  1% increase  births — about 33,000 more — last year compared   prior year.

That brought  yearly national total  just over 3.6 million babies born.

But this  different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year  women  their late 20s  30s. However,   report found birth rate declines  women  their 20s  early 30s,   change  women  their late 30s.

What happened? CDC officials said     recalculations stemming from  change   U.S. Census population estimates used  compute  birth rate.

That’ plausible, Root said. As  total population  women  childbearing  grew   immigration,  offset small increases  births  women  those  groups,  said.

Still, some   reasoning behind  approval  that  involved    smallest major railroads,  Kansas City Southern   only operator with direct lines into Mexico. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America.

The deal left only  major freight railroads, which could become  issue when regulators consider whether  approve  deal between Norfolk Southern  Union Pacific.

To  approved,  major rail merger must show  will enhance competition  serve  public interest under rules established  2001,   wake  that pair  mergers.

Hatch also said that  shippers like Amazon, Dow  U.S. Steel —   massive amounts  freight capacity — will likely weigh  with regulators   merger process develops. Those shippers will first have  determine   merger would improve their ability  move equipment  products,  harm .

“If  shippers want this this merger, they’ make  clear,” Hatch said. “They really hold  cards.”

Jeff Windau,  industry analyst with Edward Jones, expects  protracted regulatory process   STB tries  determine whether  merger will meet  standard  enhancing competition.

“While  believe there could  benefits   transcontinental railroad,   feel that  regulatory approval process would  long  challenging,” Windau said, noting that  last major railroad merger — between Canadian Pacific  Kansas City Southern — took 18 months   completed.

The International Court  Justice,  United Nations’  court, issued  advisory opinion Wednesday that found  nations must tackle climate change  those that    could  obliged   reparations   harm caused   environment.

Nikki Reisch, director  climate  energy   Center  International Environmental Law, said   “floored” when  heard  judgment.

“This   truly game-changing, momentous ruling that opens  door  climate justice  accountability  shuts  door   polluters’ impunity,”  said.

The ruling   result  years  efforts  activists  small island nations. The case  first initiated  Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change,  group  young Pacific Islanders facing  existential threat  rising  levels,     island nation  Vanuatu.

Their lobbying resulted   U.N. General Assembly voting  2023    court  take   legal question  climate change  issue  advisory opinion,  ruling that would   binding  would provide guidance  other courts  governments.

Watch  video   player above. —>

Here   takeaways from  ICJ’ ruling.

Climate change   human rights issue

The ICJ  asked  opinion   questions: What   obligation   country   against climate change? And what legal consequences should  country face  contributing  climate change that results  harm   environment?

Reading  opinion from  bench, ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa said that  U.N.  recognized that human rights   environment were related  that several nations  passed laws based  this premise.

“The human right   clean, healthy  sustainable environment  therefore inherent   enjoyment  other human rights,”  said.

“Taking into account  adverse effects  climate change   enjoyment  human rights,  Court considers that  full enjoyment  human rights cannot  ensured without  protection   climate system  other parts   environment.”

Restitution  compensation

The court found that nations responsible  emitting greenhouse gases —   fail  take action  curb emissions — could  required   reparations  victims harmed  climate change.

Restitution could “take  form  reconstructing damaged  destroyed infrastructure,  restoring ecosystems  biodiversity.”

The court said that exact restitution   “difficult  unfeasible”  achieve because environmental damage “ often  easily reversible.” In those cases, compensation “  function  addressing losses” caused  climate change.

However,  court noted that climate change compensation “  difficult  calculate  there  usually  degree  uncertainty with respect   exact extent   damage caused.”

Implementation  

Maria Antonia Tigre, director  global climate change litigation  Columbia Law School’ Sabin Center  Climate Change Law, said   “positively surprised”   opinion.

“It’ much better than I expected   ,”  said. “Because  ICJ  traditional. It’ understood    traditional court. So there [were]    people  were very cautious about what  court  actually going  recognize.”

She said that while many courts  recognized  right   healthy environment,  ICJ doing   “extremely groundbreaking.”

But even  experts welcomed  ruling, others were still skeptical   ICJ’ ability  implement climate justice.

“It’ very much about implementation. So what’ going  happen next?” asked University  Bristol  professor Folúkẹ́ Adébísí.

“It’  advisory opinion,    sense  advisory opinions   persuasive  certain nations,  only when nations want  abide   things that have been said   ICJ,”  said.

Adébísí argued that  ICJ  founded   international legal structure that  already unequal.

“It’ built upon  international legal system that develops through  dispossession   exploitation  Indigenous racialized  colonized peoples,”  said. “The very nature  international   produced  structure that doesn’ really  hasn’ returned humanity   people   dispossessed  even with  best intentions.”

Arguments against  opinion

The United States    more than 100 participants   hearing   represented  State Department legal adviser Margaret Taylor. It    several countries, mostly made   major fossil fuel producers  consumers, that argued against  expansive opinion that would find climate change  violating international human rights.

At  hearing  December, Taylor acknowledged   court that climate change represented    world’ “gravest challenges”  agreed that “urgent action”  required. But  U.S. said that treaties such   2015 Paris agreement should  “ primary framework”  guide  court’ decision rather than broader human rights .

The U.S. also argued that individual nations,  courts, should determine what should  just compensation   negative effects  climate change. Taylor also argued that countries that were contributors  global warming should only  held responsible   greenhouse gases they emitted after climate change  understood    problem.

Taylor said there   existing international human right   healthy environment  finding fault with nations most responsible  greenhouse gases would require showing direct casualty between  offender   harm done.

The court rejected many  these arguments.

Reactions around  world

The ruling  welcomed  climate activists around  world. Tigre  Reisch said they expect   have  profound impact  other court cases, government policies  future climate negotiations.

Tigre said  organization  tracked more than 90,000 climate lawsuits around  world. She believes  least some  them will  influenced   ICJ ruling.

“I think  several jurisdictions,  future litigation cases, they will follow this interpretation   ICJ,” Tigre said. “This also  some weight  political negotiations. I think even  voluntary measures ’ seen that climate litigation sometimes creates   these indirect effects even before  decision [] reached.”

Reisch  said that  hearing demonstrated  global desire  stronger action. But  said  ICJ ruling   direct message  countries like  United States  were more responsible  greenhouse  emissions.

“It’ tantamount   cease--desist notice  fossil fuel producers  really  sign   biggest polluters that they cannot persist with business  usual,” Reisch said.

“It does make  world  less hospitable place   countries that persist  conduct that  clearly violates  ,”  added.

But Adébísí said  ICJ   specify which nations must  reparations  does  have  power    while asking smaller countries, like  Pacific Island nations that pushed   ruling,  bring cases that will face opposition.

“Which states, which have  economic, military  political might, will agree   [reparations]?”  said. “This   advisory judgment that doesn’ mandate particular states   anything,   relies  states which ’ have  power  bring  claim within  system which hasn’ been their friend.”

What’ next   U.S.

Courts   U.S.   usually cite international court cases   country dropped compulsory jurisdiction with  ICJ  1986. The ICJ’ advisory opinion   likely  have  direct effect  U.S. court rulings.

“Traditionally U.S. courts haven’ really followed ICJ decisions very much,  I ’ think  will make  significant difference,” Tigre said.

However, there   more influence outside   courts among policymakers  activists.

Reisch noted that some states have begun  implement their  climate policies,   ICJ opinion  influence that legislation.

“This judgment could embolden  many state  local governments   U.S. that  taking  lead  climate action   federal government shirks  duties,” Reisch said.

She said that  effect  inspiring activists could also  significant: “The fact that this effort, spearheaded  students from  Pacific   global youth movement,  taken   states, succeeded  achieving such  momentous victory  global climate justice  accountability will inspire climate activists around  world, including here   U.S.”

President Donald Trump wants  make  easier  forcibly hospitalize homeless people suffering from mental illness  addiction  longer periods —  effort  fight what  administration calls “vagrancy” threatening  streets  U.S. cities. An executive order signed Thursday pushes federal agencies  overturn state  federal legal precedent that limits  local  state governments  involuntarily commit people  pose  risk  themselves  others.

The order said shifting homeless people into long-term institutional settings will restore public order. “Surrendering  cities  citizens  disorder  fear  neither compassionate   homeless  other citizens,” Trump’ order said.

Critics immediately warned such policy threatens returning  nation   darker  when people were often unjustly locked away  mental health institutions,  does nothing  help people afford housing.

“The safest communities  those with  most housing  resources,  those that make   crime   poor  sick,” Jesse Rabinowitz, communications director   National Homelessness Law Center, said   statement. “Forced treatment  unethical, ineffective,  illegal.”

Trump’ order instructs agencies  prioritize funding  mental health  drug courts —    fund “harm reduction” programs that  administrations said facilitate illegal drug .

The executive order  issued   Trump administration  slashed more than $1 billion  COVID- grants administered   Substance Abuse  Mental Health Services Administration   proposing  slash hundreds  millions more  agency grants.

“There’  question  need   more  address both homelessness  untreated substance  disorder  mental health conditions   U.S.,” said Regina LaBelle, director   Addiction  Public Policy Initiative   Georgetown University Law Center   former drug policy official   Biden White House. “But issuing  executive order, while disinvesting  treatment  other funding that will help prevent homelessness  untreated health conditions will  nothing  address  fundamental issues facing  country.”

The impact  Trump’ executive order remains unclear because states  laws  handle  process  involuntarily commitments.

Homelessness —  perceptions  street crime  amok —  proved  potent issue  Trump  Republican leaders   nation grapples with  mounting housing crisis.

The Supreme Court last year ruled that cities   homeless residents from sleeping outside, rejecting  constitutional challenge     anti-camping laws.

Trump signed  executive order about three months after  Justice Department asked agency officials  oversee grant distributions  brainstorm ways  clear encampments  boost involuntary hospitalizations  part   aggressive push  drive homeless people from public spaces.

Dozens  states have added   expanded involuntary commitment laws during  past decade. That includes states controlled  Democrats,  illustration that political momentum  shifted toward  more aggressive approach  dealing with  inextricably intertwined crises  mental health  addiction —  perceptions pushed   right that they lead  crime  amok.

Oregon state lawmakers, after years  contentious debate  failed attempts,  pushing forward with  bill that would make  easier  force someone    danger  themselves  others into treatment.

In California,    went into effect this year expanding  criteria    eligible  involuntary commitments  include those suffering from substance  disorders. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D),  potential presidential candidate  2026   often criticized  Trump   issue  public safety, said   would “ensure   falls through  cracks,  that people   help they need   respect they deserve.”

In New York, state lawmakers this year cemented earlier state guidance that allowed first responders  involuntarily commit people with severe mental illnesses  cannot meet their  basic needs such  obtaining medical care, shelter  food. The   pushed  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D),   faced criticism regarding public safety against  backdrop  high-profile acts  violence involving mentally  people  New York City   push  Mayor Eric Adams  more forced commitments.

While there    uptick  police officers transporting people  hospital, ’ doubtful that significantly more people will actually  admitted  forced treatment, said Patrick Wildes,  former assistant secretary  human services  mental hygiene under Hochul.

“I ’ think that there’  these people   waiting around, looking unwell,  need   picked ,”  said. “But I  think that   make some members   public feel better that,  theory, ’ easier   authorities    government    bring people .”

States beefing  involuntary commitment laws illustrates  growing recognition that officials  grown  reluctant  employ laws aimed   most severely     able  seek treatment  their , said Lisa Dailey, executive director  Treatment Advocacy Center. Those people often    jail  prison,   harm themselves  others, while conditions such  schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  untreated,  said.

The nation  long grappled with forced hospitalizations.

In 1975,  Supreme Court   landmark ruling cemented  process rights  people with mental illness, ruling they could   involuntarily committed without  showing that they posed  danger. Four years later,  court imposed  higher legal threshold  committing someone  treatment against their will.

During  campaign, Trump claimed U.S. cities  been surrendered   “drug addicted”  “dangerously deranged.” He vowed   people “ mental institutions where  belong”  floated  idea  putting them  government-sponsored tent cities.

Mr. Trump  also trying  bully  central bank into concealing  damage caused     decisions. Past presidents, including Mr. Trump   first term, pressed  Fed  lower interest rates because they wanted  boost economic growth. In recent months Mr. Trump  emphasized  second reason: He says that  Fed  making  unduly expensive   federal government  borrow money. Mr. Trump,   taken  referring  Mr. Powell  “Too Late,” wrote this month that “‘Too Late’  costing  U.S. 360 Billion Dollars  Point, PER YEAR,  refinancing costs.”

The urgency  this concern   product  Mr. Trump’ irresponsible fiscal policies. The government  increasingly vulnerable  higher interest rates because    congressional allies have pushed through legislation that will significantly increase federal borrowing  coming years. Rather than taking steps  reduce  size   debt, Mr. Trump  trying    Fed  reduce  cost. He  threatening  shift  work   central bank from controlling inflation  facilitating  government’  habits.

The danger  Americans,   global economy,  that driving down short-term interest rates —  ones  Fed most directly controls — could drive  longer-term interest rates. Investors would probably regard  sharp    Fed’ policy rate  inflationary gasoline. They would    evidence that  United States  abandoned  semblance  monetary discipline  could respond  demanding more compensation  long-term loans. Home buyers might face higher mortgage rates. Corporations might shelve projects that  longer seemed profitable. What Mr. Trump does  appear  comprehend  that  Fed influences borrowing costs   does  control those costs. It talks   market,   market talks back.

The advisers encouraging Mr. Trump should know better —  probably . They  placing their personal ambitions above  national interest. He  looking   successor  Mr. Powell,  some   contenders appear   auditioning  telling  president what  wants  hear. Kevin Warsh,  former Fed official  maintained  principled distance from Mr. Trump’ attacks  Mr. Powell during  president’ first term,  professes  agree. Kevin Hassett,  president’ chief economic adviser, seems willing  tell Mr. Trump whatever  necessary    . Scott Bessent,  Treasury secretary, appears  have  limitless appetite   humiliating work  going  television  reassure investors that  president doesn’ really mean  things  just said.

We recognize that  Fed   political institution, rather than  purely technocratic . Congress establishes  goals  oversees  performance. And  Fed’ insulation from public sentiment  sometimes impede  economic management. Technocrats   perfect. During  housing bubble   early 2000s,  example,  Fed    deferential  Wall Street. But Mr. Trump   habit  attacking imperfect institutions without  real plans  replace them with something better,    doing   this case. He  offering  solution that   worse than  underlying problem.

NEW ORLEANS -- The stench  trash  residue   decisions    America’ favorite party hotspots  being scrubbed away, thanks   change  garbage collectors that New Orleans residents   transformed  French Quarter.

“The Quarter  never been this clean,” said Jill Wagner. She became inured during  three decades living along Bourbon Street  -infested, overflowing garbage cans  sidewalks stained with puke, urine  booze. Now, with  zesty lemon fragrance sprayed across  streets daily, " smells like Disney World.”

A chorus  residents  business owners  heaping praise   city' -called “Trash King," Sidney Torres IV,   company, IV Waste,  cracking  code  sanitary success.

The district  gleamed since Torres  given  emergency year-long contract last December  handle  waste management, they . Tourists stumbling    Bourbon Street  around sunrise   given   find IV Waste employees power-washing sidewalks, scooping  cigarette butts  spritzing streets with  patented “lemon fresh” cleaning formula.

But  judge  Wednesday allowed Mayor LaToya Cantrell  replace IV Waste     July, over  objections   city council. With  local management district insisting  Torres, this raises  possibility  rival collectors competing   French Quarter' garbage.

“Just because they like  other , that   enough,”  mayor' attorney Charles Rice told  judge,   said there' “ reason”  believe  different contractor would  worse.

A state appeals court  scheduled  review  August  will ultimately earn tens  millions  dollars managing  French Quarter' trash  2026  beyond.

At stake   attractiveness  some   most important city blocks   country, residents  — New Orleans reports that more than 19 million visitors spent  collective $10 billion last year,  most visited  historic French Quarter.

In  city plagued  dysfunction including constant flooding, treacherous potholes   massive jailbreak, Torres' company  become  point  civic pride. The quarter  filled with signs  support  IV Waste.

“It’  even   same solar system --  service they provide versus what others provide,” said Danny Conwill,  owns  oyster   Bourbon Street   suing  mayor  keep IV Waste. He recalls other trash collectors leaving “noxious garbage juices”  heaps  shrimp heads  oyster shells scattered about, leading  rank summer odors   business.

Torres,  real estate developer  began   personal assistant  Lenny Kravitz  once hosted Justin Bieber' 20th birthday party   Bahamas resort, became  local celebrity  reality TV star after launching  trash company  clean   city after Hurricane Katrina. He then sold   waited   -compete clause before rebuilding  trash empire with IV Waste.

After  competitive bidding process last year,  city began negotiating  $73 million contract with another local firm, Henry Consulting,  clean  French Quarter   least  next five years. But before  deal  finalized, council members grew alarmed that  company   seem  have  necessary equipment  subcontracts  place  Super Bowl LIX   annual Mardi Gras celebrations loomed.

IV Waste then   emergency contract  clean  French Quarter through 2025,  Henry Consulting sued, accusing  city  failing  uphold  valid contract.

The metastasizing litigation  pits  outgoing mayor with waning popularity against  feisty city council  state officials including  attorney general, with both sides slinging accusations  cronyism. Cantrell  elected  2017 with  endorsement  Henry Consulting founder Troy Henry.

In April, Cantrell announced   terminating  IV Waste contract early,  that Henry' firm would take over. This  - contract would cost $2.1 million more, with inferior results, sanitation director Matt Torri told  city council  Monday. He  other officials said Henry Consulting still doesn' seem ready   .

Henry Consulting declined  comment  The Associated Press. Cantrell' office told The AP that  city “remains committed  working with  parties  provide sanitation services   French Quarter.”

Meanwhile,   Louisiana  empowers  management district  appoint   garbage collector,   residents  business owners   this state agency selected IV Waste. Torres said  company will keep taking   trash, even   means rivals  --  Bourbon Street.

“We’ going    ,  they  watch  learn," Torres said. “The French Quarter  rest assured that ’ going  continue  clean.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A judge’ order  take  Tennessee death  inmate   hospital   morning   execution  doctors  deactivate  heart-regulating implant would cause “chaos,” state attorneys said   appeal.

The argument    several   filing Wednesday that seeks  overturn  order  deactivate Byron Black' implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, including when  where   . Black  scheduled    lethal injection  Aug. 5  10 ..

His attorneys   heart device would continuously shock    attempt  restore  heart’ normal rhythm during  execution,   state disputes that  argues that even  shocks were triggered, that Black wouldn' feel them.

Officials said they would need  transfer Black through Nashville  morning   execution  comply with  judge' order,  that  trip would create security risks, including from protestors. It' about 7 miles from Riverbend Maximum Security Institution  Nashville General Hospital.

Kelley Henry, Black' attorney, said  state presented “zero evidence  security risk"  said state officials were  ones  made  proposed time  place   hospital procedure public.

The Tennessee Supreme Court  taking   appeal  fast-tracking .

A judge sided with Black' attorneys last week, initially ruling that  state must turn   heart device   minutes just before  execution.

Black       single dose   barbiturate pentobarbital.

His cardioverter-defibrillator   small, battery-powered electronic instrument that  surgically implanted  someone’ chest, usually near  left collarbone. It   deactivated with  handheld machine,   state says Black’ doctors have refused  come   prison   .

The state asked  judge  either overturn  order about  deactivation  allow  Tennessee Department  Correction  take Black   hospital     before  execution. After  hearing Tuesday,  judge adjusted  order    state needs  take Black   hospital  morning   execution rather than deactivating  device minutes before .

Henry told  judge  deactivation needs  happen immediately before  execution  authorities ' risk accidentally killing Black just before  possible reprieve.

In  appeal, state  repeated arguments that  lower-court judge lacked authority  order  device disabled.

The state   saying that  order  transport Black   hospital  morning   execution presents  “very real risk  danger  TDOC personnel, hospital patients/staff,  public,  even Black.”

Henry said there' “ appreciable difference” between transporting Black Aug. 5  Aug. 4, which  when  state proposed taking    hospital after  judge ordered  deactivation. She also said there'  risk   transportation.

“Mr. Black cannot walk,” Henry said. "He   frail, 69 year  , with  history  clear conduct. And  idea that  group  pacifists  protest executions  prayer would  some  create  ruckus during transport  simply  believable.”

Black  convicted   1988 shooting deaths  girlfriend Angela Clay, 29,    daughters, Latoya, 9,  Lakeisha, 6. Prosecutors said     jealous rage when  shot  three  their home. At  time, Black   work-release while serving time  shooting  wounding Clay’ estranged husband.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Department  Agriculture will move thousands  employees    nation' capital   reorganization  agency says will  them closer  customers while saving money, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Thursday.

Around 2,600 workers — more than half  Washington, D.C. workforce — will  moved  five hubs stretching from North Carolina  Utah, Rollins said. The union representing federal workers immediately criticized  plan   ploy   federal jobs, pointing  that some 95%   department' employees already work outside Washington.

The move  part  President Donald Trump' effort  make  federal government slimmer  more efficient, which received  Supreme Court boost this month.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes,  fuels this nation   world,    long past time  department better serve  great  patriotic farmers, ranchers,  producers   mandated  support,” Rollins said   statement.

The goal   -size  department  that costs ' outstrip available finances,  well  eliminate layers  management  consolidate redundant functions,  statement said. The department expects  plan  take several months.

The five hubs   Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Fort Collins, Colorado; Indianapolis  Salt Lake City.

Although ’ important   closer  farmers  ranchers, Chad Hart,  professor  agricultural economics  Iowa State University, said taking those employees   Washington risks losing  important connection  Congress.

“You want that balance”  ensure effective farm policy, Hart said.

Much   government savings could come from employees  choose   relocate, Hart said. He added that  agricultural community  concerned about  “bumpy transition” reminiscent  similar action during Trump’ first term, when  took relocated Agriculture offices months     running again.

Everett Kelley, national president   American Federation  Government Employees,  labor union representing federal workers,   sharper critique. He said about 85%   federal employees already work outside  capital,  insisted Washington “  center   nation’ government   reason."

Workers  headquarters help coordinate between senior leaders  field offices, Kelley said,  they ensure  agency   “seat   table” when lawmakers   White House make decisions that affect farmers nationwide.

“I’ concerned this reorganization  just  latest attempt  eliminate USDA workers  minimize their critical work,”  union leader said.

The Agriculture Department reported that  headcount grew  8% over  past four years, with salaries increasing  14.5%. The statement from Rollins said  4,600 employees   around Washington  “underutilized  redundant”  housed  underused buildings with billions  dollars  deferred maintenance.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- A Maryland    wrongly imprisoned  32 years, including  decade  death ,   killings    commit  suing former  enforcement officials   lawsuit announced Thursday, though four   five people named  defendants  deceased.

John Huffington  pardoned  then-Gov. Larry Hogan  January 2023. Hogan cited prosecutorial misconduct  granting  full innocence pardon  Huffington  connection with  1981 double slaying  Harford County. A Maryland board approved $2.9 million  compensation  Huffington later that year during Gov. Wes Moore' administration.

Huffington said   statement Thursday that “ took many, many painful years,   truth eventually came .” Just 18   time   arrest,  said neither   parents ever     understand that  name  been cleared     free.

"All  those years I spent behind bars damaged  strained  relationships, cost   ability  have  family   , cost   ability   with  mother when  died, cost  precious time with  father     nineties  suffering from Alzheimer’ when I finally  released,”  added.

Huffington, 62, always maintained  innocence. He  released from Patuxent Institution  2013 after serving 32 years   life sentences.

He  convicted twice   killings known   “Memorial Day Murders.” Diane Becker  stabbed  death   recreational vehicle, while  4-year- ,   inside,   harmed. Joseph Hudson, Becker’ boyfriend,  fatally shot  found   miles (kilometers) away. A second suspect   slayings testified against Huffington,  convicted  first-degree murder,  served 27 years.

Prosecutors relied  testimony that  later discredited about hair found   crime scene purportedly matching Huffington’.

He appealed  first conviction  1981. In 1983,  jury found  guilty  first-degree murder    sentenced  death. Prosecutors later commuted that sentence   life terms.

Questions about evidence   case arose when The Washington Post uncovered  FBI report  2011 that found  FBI agent  analyzed hair evidence  Huffington’ case   have used reliable science,  even tested  hair  . The report  been written  1999,  Harford County State’ Attorney Joseph Cassilly didn' provide   Huffington’ lawyers.

A Frederick County judge vacated Huffington’ convictions  ordered   trial  2013 after Huffington presented  evidence using DNA testing that   available during  earlier trials. When  hair evidence  tested  DNA more than 30 years later,  results showed    Huffington’ hair.

Maryland’ highest court unanimously voted  disbar Cassilly  2021. The court found  withheld exculpatory evidence   1981 double murder  lied about    following years.

Cassilly,  maintained   nothing wrong, retired  2019. He died  January.

His brother, Bob Cassilly,     Harford County executive, said   statement that  brother   decorated  hero   injured while serving  country  served   county' state' attorney  36 years while   wheelchair.

“Joe cannot defend himself  this decades- matter because    deceased,    other named defendants, except     almost 80,” Cassilly said. “Harford County government,  which I currently serve  county executive,   role  this case --  county  never  defendants’ employer."

Huffington also  suing  assistant state’ attorney   case, Gerard Comen,  Harford County government,   county sheriff’ office detectives, David Saneman, William Van Horn  Wesley J. Picha. All  Saneman   dead, according   lawsuit filed July 15  federal court  Baltimore.

Saneman told The Washington Post  Wednesday    seen  heard   lawsuit  declined  comment.

FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank will likely hold   making another interest rate  Thursday, choosing  wait until   measure  size   economic blow from higher U.S. tariffs.

With  bench mark rate   2%, down from  record high  4%, analyst think there could   more rate  coming,  only  September.

The reason,  analysts: The ECB' policymakers simply ' know  outcome  talks between  EU' executive commission   Trump administration. Trump first   20% tariff  EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure   pace  talks, then sent  EU  letter informing officials   potential 30% tariff. EU officials earlier held  hope  winning  least  10% baseline that applies  almost  trade partners,  analysts think that  actual rate   lower than Trump' tariff threats. The talks   against  Aug. 1 deadline,  earlier deadlines have slipped   sides kept talking.

The decision  hold rates unchanged will  “uncontroversial” among members   bank' rate-setting council, said analysts  UniCredit' Investment Institute.

“In light  recent events,  risk   adverse tariff scenario  increased since  June ECB meeting. The 30% tariff  EU goods threatened   US  much higher than generally expected,”  UniCredit analysts wrote. "However,  response  financial markets  US President Donald Trump’ letter   EU  been muted,  this seems  reflect expectations that  landing point  tariffs  EU goods will  materially below 30%.

BOGOTA, Colombia -- Peruvian customs officials have seized  record-breaking shipment  illegal mercury, exposing  cross-border smuggling network that  fueling    Amazon’ most destructive criminal economies: illicit gold mining.

The 4- haul —  largest mercury seizure ever made   Amazon country     world' largest —  discovered  June   port  Callao, hidden inside gravel-filled bags   cargo ship bound  Bolivia. Though labeled  crushed stone,  shipment  flagged  customs agents based  international intelligence sharing.

“This crushed stone  laced with mercury,” said Jorge Gallo Alvarado, head  customs enforcement  SUNAT, Peru’   customs agency. “It’  restricted substance because ’ used  illegal alluvial mining.”

The container, which originated  Mexico,  singled   inspection  SUNAT’ risk analysis team. U.S. specialists later confirmed  presence  mercury embedded   gravel —  tactic increasingly used  avoid detection  ports.

The seized goods  valued  roughly $500,000, SUNAT said.

Authorities   bust marks  turning point  efforts  dismantle  supply chains behind  Amazon’ illicit gold trade. Mercury,  powerful neurotoxin banned  tightly restricted  many countries, remains essential   process used  illegal miners across  rainforest  extract gold from river sediment.

The method  simple  dangerous: miners  mercury with gold particles  form  amalgam, then burn  , releasing toxic vapor into  . The leftover mercury often flows into rivers, where  transforms into methylmercury —  most dangerous form —  builds   fish  aquatic life.

“This   very important seizure,” said Luis Fernandez,  research professor  mercury expert  Wake Forest University  North Carolina,  traveled  Lima  assess  find.

“We ’ often  mercury seizures  this scale, especially   transit through formal customs points,"  said.

Fernandez estimated  mercury could have been used  produce roughly 1,600 kilograms (3,527 pounds)  gold — worth more than $172 million  current prices.

“This ’ subsistence mining,”  said. “It’ organized, high-value illicit trade with serious environmental  public health consequences.”

In Peru’ Madre  Dios region,  epicenter  illegal mining, mercury contamination  been detected  drinking water, fish  even breast milk. Long-term exposure  methylmercury  cause irreversible damage   brain  nervous system, particularly  children  pregnant women. Indigenous  riverine communities that rely  fish  food  especially vulnerable.

Peruvian authorities  much   mercury entering  country  smuggled from Mexico, where ’ mined  central states such  Querétaro. Prices have surged  recent years   booming global demand  gold, reaching  high  $330  kilogram  mercury —  more than $3,500  ounce  gold — earlier this year.

Some   mercury seized  June  believed  have originated  small, artisanal mines inside  UNESCO ‑protected biosphere reserve.

While  Environmental Investigation Agency,  nonprofit watchdog that investigates environmental crime,  documented that  least 30 tons  mercury have been trafficked annually from Mexico  countries like Peru  Colombia   single criminal network,  real volume  likely higher. Soaring gold prices   400% markup  mercury   Amazon compared  Mexico have made smuggling increasingly lucrative. Seizures  monitoring suggest flows rose   estimated 56 tons  2024, with further increases expected this year. Colombia remains    highest  capita emitters  mercury worldwide, with total annual releases reaching   150 tons, much   tied  illegal gold mining.

EIA’ latest investigation, released  tandem with Peru' announcement, describes  growing “gold-mercury-drug trifecta” linking illegal mining  transnational crime  environmental degradation. The group’ investigators documented  organized criminal groups — including Mexico’ Jalisco New Generation Cartel —   involved  mercury mining  trafficking.

“Until mercury mines   longer  operation, traffickers will leave  stone unturned  smuggle  metal,”  report states.

Traffickers often disguise mercury shipments with false paperwork  front companies, allowing them  slip through customs. Once across  border,  metal  sold  illegal mining camps — often  protected forests  Indigenous territories — where  becomes almost impossible  trace.

In Colombia, security sources  armed groups such   National Liberation Army   Gulf Clan play  central role   mercury--gold trade. Similar dynamics have been reported  Brazil  Bolivia, where enforcement  weak  black-market demand  high.

Although Peru ratified  Minamata Convention  Mercury  2013, enforcement  struggled  keep  with  pace  adaptability  trafficking networks.

“These networks  agile,” Fernandez said. “As gold prices rise, they adapt quickly. Customs authorities need tools, training,  resources  keep pace.”

Adam Dolezal, extractive industries campaigner  EIA, said  seizure shows what  possible when customs systems  properly resourced  coordinated —  warned that enforcement alone ’ stop  trade.

“Unless mercury production  shut down   source, this toxic trade will continue,” Dolezal said.

The U.K., France  Germany were signatories   2015 deal. The U.S. withdrew  2018 during  first term  President Donald Trump,  insisted  agreement wasn’ tough enough.

Iranian officials have warned that  move  reimpose sanctions would have consequences. Gharibabadi said earlier this week that  could force Tehran  withdraw from  -proliferation agreements.

In  letter  U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, Iran' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi accused  E3  hypocrisy, saying they failed  uphold their obligations under  2015 deal while supporting Israel’ recent strikes  Iran.

In  interview with Al Jazeera that aired  Wednesday, Pezeshkian said Iran  prepared  another   accused Israel  attempting  assassinate  during  June 15 meeting  Iran' national security council  Tehran.

Pezeshkian reiterated that Iran’ nuclear program will continue within  framework  international   insisted  country   intention  pursuing nuclear weapons.

“Our nuclear capabilities    minds   scientists,”  said, emphasizing Iran’ position that future negotiations must  rooted  mutual respect,  threats.

According   official judicial news agency Mizan,  least 13 Iranian nuclear scientists were killed during  12-  between Iran  Israel.

A spokesman  Iran’ Atomic Energy Organization said Thursday  country’ nuclear industry would recover from  recent attacks  Israel   United States.

“Our nuclear industry  deeply rooted. What  roots cannot  harmed  attack  pressure —  will grow back  thrive again,” state TV quoted Behrouz Kamalvandi  saying.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, known   acronym IAEA, reported  May that Iran’ stockpile  uranium enriched  60%  grown  over 400 kilograms (882 pounds). That material, just below weapons-grade level, remains  central concern   West.

Despite  growing stockpile, Iran  said  remains open  diplomacy, though  recently suspended cooperation with  IAEA following legislation signed  Pezeshkian.

The road ahead remains uncertain. While European officials  they want  avoid further conflict   open   negotiated solution, they have warned that time  running .

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary' populist prime minister  spent years building  close political relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump  aligning himself with  MAGA movement.

But despite Viktor Orbán' success  gaining favor with  culturally conservative  nationalist wing  Trump' administration,  country  poised   among those hard   Trump' tariffs against  European Union.

Trump earlier this month announced  would levy tariffs  30% against Mexico   EU beginning Aug. 1 —  move that could cause massive upheaval between  United States   27-member EU,  which Hungary   member.

As  small, export-oriented economy with major automobile, pharmaceutical  wine industries — some   main categories  products Europe exports   U.S. — Hungary will  particularly vulnerable  Trump’ tariffs.

The duties “would   Hungarian economy   very, very difficult situation, because then  entire possibility  Hungary  export  America would  essentially eliminated,” Péter Virovácz, chief analyst  ING Hungary, told The Associated Press.

Hungary’ largest trading partners  other EU countries like Germany, Italy  Romania,  well  China,  many Hungarian companies export their goods across  Atlantic. Outgoing trade   United States represents around 15%   Hungarian exports  countries outside  EU.

One such enterprise,  Budapest-based company specializing  Hungarian wine, said  will likely cease doing business   U.S. altogether   30% duty  levied   products.

“If ’ really going   30%, then there   more shipment ... We might just call         year,” said Gábor Bánfalvi, -owner  Taste Hungary.

Bánfalvi’ company  been shipping around 10,000 bottles  premium Hungarian wine  year   U.S.  about half  decade. With  base  Washington D.C.,  exports  range    white wines  clients  numerous U.S. states including specialty wine shops  bars.

Until , “’ been  thin profit margin,  ’ been fine because  want Hungarian wine   available”  U.S. consumers, Bánfalvi said.

“Then came 2025,"  said.

When Trump began imposing tariffs  EU exports earlier this year,  cost  Taste Hungary’ shipments tripled, Bánfalvi said — price hikes    build into  sticker price   wine. The imposition  30% tariffs would make exporting “unsustainable.”

“You just start  think,    doing this? Is  really worth ? It’ just   best   make money,”  said.

In total,  value  EU-U.S. trade  goods  services  2024 amounted  1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion.)

Hungary’ government,  vocal proponent  Trump’ “patriotic” foreign policy prioritizing national interests,  acknowledged that  tariffs would present  challenge. But, careful   criticize  Trump administration,   instead blamed  EU,  frequent target  Orbán’ scorn,  failing  reach  comprehensive trade agreement with Washington.

Confident that  right-wing populist policies would help   favor with Trump’ administration, Orbán said   interview  April that while tariffs “will   disadvantage,”  government  negotiating “other economic agreements  issues that will offset them.”

But Péter Krekó, director   Budapest-based Political Capital think tank, expressed doubt that political affinities could play  meaningful role  mitigating damage  Hungary’ economy caused  Trump’ trade policy.

“The unquestionably good bilateral relations simply cannot compensate   trade conflicts between  EU   U.S.,    consequence, Hungary will suffer  tariffs  same  that  EU will,” Krekó said. “Mutual nationalisms cannot  coordinated    that   going    - situation.”

Virovácz,  economist, pointed  that Hungary  home  numerous automobile factories  major automakers like Audi  Mercedes. The manufacturing  cars  motor vehicle parts represents  “overwhelming majority”   country’ total exports,  said.

Pharmaceuticals make   even larger share  Hungarian exports   United States —  industry  which Trump this month threatened  impose 200% tariffs. That “will essentially kill European  thus Hungarian exports  America," Virovácz said.

“It’ impossible  tariffs   levied  EU products    Hungarian ones,”  said. “A theoretical option  that Trump could somehow compensate Hungary because ’  good terms with  Hungarian political leadership,   that only starts happening , ’   late.”

Krekó,  political analyst, said Trump’ administration “gives practically nothing  free. If Hungary ... cannot fulfill  interests   U.S., then I think Hungary   going  receive gifts.”

“Hungary just doesn’ have  cards,   Trump’ terminology,”  added.

The fractured friendship behind  fight   Thailand-Cambodia border

Watch: People take shelter after gunfire breaks  between Thailand  Cambodia troops

Cambodia  Thailand have  history  occasional conflict. The  countries share  long  forested border with areas that both sides claim. There have been serious exchanges  fire   past,  –  2008  2011, clashes   similar scale  40 people killed. However, these were -escalated relatively quickly. Even  recently  this May, after  incident  which  Cambodian soldier  killed, both sides looked keen  prevent more violence, with meetings between army commanders from each country aimed  easing  tension. But  24 July,  erupted. Thai authorities  12 people,  civilians apart from , were killed. Cambodia    confirm whether  suffered  casualties. So   this particular border skirmish – which kicked  after five Thai soldiers were injured   landmine explosion  Wednesday – spread into something  much larger? Relations between   countries deteriorated sharply last month, when Cambodia' senior leader Hun Sen deeply embarrassed Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra  leaking  phone conversation between them about  disputed border. In  conversation, Paetongtarn called  "uncle",  criticised     military commanders, sparking public anger. She  since been suspended  prime minister  Thailand' Constitutional Court  considering  petition   dismissal. It   clear  Hun Sen chose   this, burning  close personal relationship between their  families that goes back decades.

Many people have faulted Paetongtarn   conversation with Hun Sen. She appeared  believe that  could resolve their differences  appealing   friendship with  father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. In  past that friendship  used  Thaksin' opponents  charge  with putting Cambodia' interests above those  Thailand. In 2014, when  government headed  Thaksin' sister Yingluck  deposed   military coup, Hun Sen allowed scores   supporters  seek sanctuary  Cambodia. The  countries have also cooperated  more shadowy areas. Last November, Thailand sent  Cambodian dissidents, together with  young child, back  Cambodia, where they were immediately jailed. All were recognised   United Nations  refugees.

And  January gunning down   Cambodian opposition leader  broad daylight  central Bangkok  also seen  activists   outcome  this understanding between   countries' security services. Against this background,  leaking  Paetongtarn' conversation appears  have caught  Shinawatra family completely -guard. The responses from both Thaksin  Paetongtarn reveal  sense  betrayal. This     increasingly bitter   words between   countries. But   more than just words. Thai police have also begun investigating powerful Cambodian business figures alleged   linked  underworld gambling  scam centres, while trade worth billions  dollars  year  stopped. At  border itself, there   heightened risk  more serious clashes between   armies. But rather than back , Cambodia' Hun Sen seems  have jumped   opportunity  ramp  rhetoric against Thailand   Shinawatra family  particular. He claims    possession  secret documents that would incriminate Thaksin – documents  claims could even prove that  insulted  monarchy,  offence which comes with  hefty prison sentence  Thailand. The Thai government responded  expelling  Cambodian ambassador  Wednesday  recalling   envoy, setting  stage   latest confrontation.

The charity estimates  answers  call  help every 10 seconds.

The proposals were revealed   video message sent   leadership   charity  volunteers last week.

Chief executive Julie Bentley, said while there wasn' " definitive view"   many branches  charity needed: "It' likely that within  next seven  10 years  branch network will have reduced   least half.

"With less branches, ' look  move  fewer  bigger regions,"  added.

Volunteers  answer  calls  based  offices around  country, many  which will  close.

The BBC  been told more than 50 branches, over  quarter   total, have been raising concerns   internal forum since  proposals were announced.

Plans  "virtual volunteering" where people answer calls from home, have sparked fears volunteers could leave  charity    pressures  dealing with calls about suicide alone.

Others only decided  help    feeling isolated  home.

Female volunteers have also said they would  uncomfortable with remote working    number  abusive  sexual calls  charity receives.

In  message  staff, Ms Bentley said some offices were failing  retain enough volunteers  "' support  effective delivery   services  callers".

She also expressed concern that  much   Samaritans' income  spent  "maintaining bricks  mortars, rather than being used  improve  services".

But    loss   intimacy  support  offices provide that worries many volunteers.

"Make sure  reindeer have plenty  water -  ' forget  drink  glass every hour ," Santa reminds  team  elves busy making presents  next Christmas  Lapland swelters   record heatwave. It'  every  that Father Christmas finds himself briefing  elves about  hazards  sunstroke,  this summer northern Finland  seen temperatures hover around 30C  days  . As  Santa,  will  staying indoors most    -  bright  costume trimmed with   very warm. "I' only going    swim   lake   forest after 18:00, when  weather  started  cool ,"  says.

While Santa' workshop   city  Rovaniemi  adapting with cheerful resilience,  unusually warm temperatures   Arctic   serious matter –  scientists  pointing  climate change   culprit. After  unusually cold  rainy spring  early summer,  whole  Finland – including   north  Lapland, 500km (310 miles) above  Arctic Circle – suddenly became caught    continuous spell   weather. By 25 July,  heatwave  Rovaniemi will have lasted 15 days.

In Finland  heatwave  defined   period   least three consecutive days where  daily maximum temperature exceeds 25C. Finnish Meteorological Institute' meteorologist Jaakko Savela explains that  Lapland, where temperatures over 30C  extremely rare, heatwaves like  current   exceptional. "The last time Finnish Lapland   similarly long heatwave   1972," Savela says. But even that only lasted 12  14 days, depending   exact location. "That record   been broken." It'  just Rovaniemi that' been gripped  scorching temperatures. Several other weather stations across Lapland have registered their longest ever heatwaves since records began. The highest temperature   heatwave, 31.7C,  measured   locations, Ylitornio  Sodankylä, earlier this week. That' about 10C above  seasonal average  Lapland.

BBC/Erika Benke The thermometer   Santa Claus village  Lapland this week read 33C   

The heatwave  prompted renewed concern about  accelerating pace  climate change   Arctic, which  warming four  five times faster than  rest   Earth. Savela notes that this particular, long heatwave   directly caused  climate change. However,  says, "Climate change    impact: without , temperatures over  last  weeks would have been lower". Prof Jeff Weller, University   Arctic Research Chair   University  Oulu, agrees. What  climate change?

“While there ’  hard--fast rule  cleaning electronics,  generally  high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because  evaporates quickly,”  said. “The faster  liquid evaporates,  less likely    affect  components that conduct electricity.”

For whatever device ' cleaning, disconnect  power   first. Remove  cases, plugs, covers  accessories.

When using  computer,  keyboard  mouse   parts that  touched most often  therefore need  most frequent cleaning. And  those crevices between  keyboard' keys  sure  catch crumbs.

If  ’ have compressed , Logitech suggests using  hair dryer   cold  setting. Some social media users also recommend  handheld balloon pump.

Next, dampen  cleaning cloth with water  gently wipe down  keyboard  mouse.

Logitech says   also  rubbing alcohol  recommends  test  first   inconspicuous spot  make sure  doesn' cause discoloration  scrub  lettering   keys.

Anti-bacterial baby wipes  also work  devices like  mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.

“There shouldn’  enough liquid  seep through cracks   shell,  their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap  water,”  said.

For laptop screens  external monitors,    microfiber cloth  gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.

If there  more stubborn spots — like food stains  sneezy spatters — dampen  cloth with distilled water   50/50 solution  distilled water  vinegar.

Computer maker Lenovo says  “gentle acidity  vinegar  help break down oils  fingerprints.” Avoid using household glass cleaners, which  contain ammonia that could damage  screen. The same goes  paper towels, which  scratch  screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.

A   people listen  music  podcasts through their earbuds,  that also means they' need regular cleaning  remove  earwax, natural skin oils  other grungy buildup.

If  earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending  your brand  model. Logitech  Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water   wipes because they  speed deterioration, , instead, advises using   cloth.

Use  cotton swab  wipe  earbud nozzles clean.

To clean  rest   AirPod' body,   damp cloth. And ' forget about  charging case. Apple recommends brushing   debris  then wiping with   cloth. If needed, dampen  with isopropyl alcohol.

What about over-- headphones? Bose says  should wipe them down  least once  week, especially after working ,  remove  dirt  bacteria hiding   nooks  crannies. Remove  pads    cloth dampened with soapy water  clean them.

It  difficult  date petroglyphs,   archaeological site   area  from about 600 years , said Laura Gilda,  archaeologist with U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. According  Kila, Hawaiians arrived  Waianae  least 1,000 years .

The beach here fluctuates  size  profile each year, with -pressure weather systems that form   eastern Pacific between May  November causing waves that  away loose sand from shorelines  redeposit them further , according   Army report   petroglyphs. That shift  likely what causes their temporary exposure.

Archaeologists identified  total  26 petroglyphs. Of  18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight  depicted with possible male genitalia   remainder   undetermined gender,  report said.

The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.

When  petroglyphs first reemerged  July 2016,   after late spring  early summer storms, including hurricanes, with    wave action that swept  sand away, Gilda said.

They remained visible   period  then  covered again.

“So there' been portions that have ... been exposed since then,  this   first summer that  whole panel  been exposed again,” Gilda said.

Kila said that when  military   1930s took over  area  evicted Native Hawaiians, including  family  lived there  generations,  great-great grandmother refused  leave   family exchanged mountain lands with  coffee plantation   could remain near  .

In  interview included   Army' report,  recalled growing   Waianae without television. So " ocean  mountains were  playground,”  said. The Army recreation center  -limits   pubic,   seawall   barrier between Native Hawaiians   military, Kila said.

Kila,  72, recalled that  they walked     wall, they were clubbed  pushed   military police.

“We were proud  knew where  came from,   never fostered  hatred   military because    believed that  land will eventually return  ,”  said.

Kila, while visiting  petroglyphs earlier this week, told The Associated Press that  Army' protection  them represents  shift  that community relationship.

Officials have been grappling with   share  petroglyphs with  community while also protecting them, Gilda said.

“How much attention   want  bring  this area? You ’ really want people   digging  them when they’  exposed,"  said. "But they’ certainly awesome  come     public beachscape.”

Academics around  country  raising alarm about growing efforts  define antisemitism  terms pushed   Trump administration

NEW YORK -- For years, Marianne Hirsch,  prominent genocide scholar  Columbia University,  used Hannah Arendt’ book about  trial   Nazi  criminal, “Eichmann  Jerusalem: A Report   Banality  Evil,”  spark discussion among  students about  Holocaust   lingering traumas.

But after Columbia’ recent adoption    definition  antisemitism, which casts certain criticism  Israel  hate speech, Hirsch fears   face official sanction  even mentioning  landmark text  Arendt,  philosopher  criticized Israel' founding.

For  first time since  started teaching five decades , Hirsch,  daughter   Holocaust survivors,   thinking  leaving  classroom altogether.

“A university that treats criticism  Israel  antisemitic  threatens sanctions  those  disobey   longer  place  open inquiry,”  told The Associated Press. “I just ’   I  teach about genocide  that environment.”

Hirsch   alone. At universities across  country, academics have raised alarm about growing efforts  define antisemitism  terms pushed   Trump administration, often under  threat  federal funding cuts.

Promoted   International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,  definition lists 11 examples  antisemitic conduct, such  applying “double standards”  Israel, comparing  country’ policies  Nazism  describing  existence  “ racist endeavor.”

Ahead   $220 million settlement with  Trump administration announced Wednesday, Columbia agreed  incorporate  IHRA definition   examples into  disciplinary process. It  been endorsed  some form  Harvard, Yale  dozens  other universities.

While supporters   semantic shift  necessary  combat evolving forms  Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn  will further suppress -Palestinian speech already under attack  President Donald Trump.

For Hirsch,  restrictions  drawing comparisons   Holocaust  questioning Israel’ founding amount  “clear censorship,” which  fears will chill discussions   classroom  open   other faculty   spurious lawsuits.

“We learn  making analogies,” Hirsch said. “Now  university  saying that’ -limits. How   have  university course where ideas     discussion  interpretation?”

A spokesperson  Columbia didn’ respond   emailed request  comment.

When  first drafted  IHRA definition  antisemitism  decades , Kenneth Stern said  “never imagined  would   serve   hate speech code.”

At  time, Stern  working   lead antisemitism expert   American Jewish Committee. The definition   examples were meant  serve   broad framework  help European countries track bias against Jews,  said.

In recent years, Stern  spoken forcefully against what  sees   “weaponization” against -Palestinian activists, including anti-Zionist Jews.

“People  believe they’ combating hate  seduced  simple solutions  complicated issues,”  said. “But when used  this context, ’ really actually harming  ability  think about antisemitism.”

Stern said  delivered that warning  Columbia’ leaders last fall after being invited  address them  Claire Shipman, then  -chair   board  trustees   university’ current interim president.

The conversation seemed productive, Stern said. But  March, shortly after  Trump administration said  would withhold $400 million  federal funding  Columbia over concerns about antisemitism,  university announced  would adopt  IHRA definition  “training  educational” purposes.

Then last week, days before announcing  deal with  Trump administration  restore that funding, Shipman said  university would extend  IHRA definition  disciplinary purposes, deploying  examples when assessing “discriminatory intent.”

“The formal incorporation  this definition will strengthen  response    community’ understanding  modern antisemitism,” Shipman wrote.

Stern,   serves  director   Bard Center   Study  Hate, called  move “appalling," predicting  would spur   wave  litigation against  university while further curtailing -Palestinian speech.

Already,  university’ disciplinary body  faced backlash  investigating students  criticized Israel  -  other venues, often   behest  -Israel groups.

“With this  edict  IHRA, ’ going  have more outside groups looking  what professors  teaching, what’   syllabus, filing complaints  applying public pressure   people fired,”  said. “That will undoubtedly harm  university.”

Beyond adopting  IHRA definition, Columbia  also agreed  place  Middle East studies department under  supervision, overhaul  rules  protests  coordinate antisemitism trainings with groups like  Anti-Defamation League.

Earlier this week,  university suspended  expelled nearly 80 students  participated  -Palestinian demonstrations.

Kenneth Marcus, chair   Louis D. Brandeis Center  Human Rights Under Law, said Columbia’ actions were  overdue step  protect Jewish students from harassment.

He dismissed faculty concerns about  IHRA definition, which  said would “provide clarity, transparency  standardization”   university’ effort  root  antisemitism.

“There  undoubtedly some Columbia professors  will feel they cannot continue teaching under   regime,” Marcus said. “To  extent that they self-terminate,      them personally,          students  Columbia University.”

But Hirsch,  Columbia professor, said   committed  continuing  long-standing study  genocides  their aftermath.

Part  that work,  said, will involve talking  students about Israel’ "ongoing ethnic cleansing  genocide”  Gaza, where more than 58,000 Palestinians have died, over half  them women  children, according  Gaza’ Health Ministry.

“With this capitulation  Trump,     impossible   that inside Columbia,” Hirsch said. “If that’  case, I’ continue  work outside  university’ gates.”

It comes  Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces fresh calls from within Labour' ranks  make  move, amid warnings  mass starvation  Gaza,  after France indicated  would  doing  within months. In   report,  Labour  Lib Dem MPs   select committee argue that statehood   "inalienable right" that should "  made conditional". But their  Tory colleagues said  state  Palestine should only  recognised  part   long-term political solution   conflict   Middle East, echoing  Labour government' position.

French President Emmanuel Macron said  Thursday evening that  country would officially recognise  Palestinian state   UN meeting  September. Sir Keir  previously said  UK should reserve recognition  Palestinian statehood  when  would have  "greatest impact" - without specifying when this would . But   report published  Friday,  committee said  government should make  move "while there  still  state  recognise". "An inalienable right should   made conditional,"  report adds. "The government cannot continue  wait   perfect time because experience shows that there will never   perfect time." That section   report  backed    Labour MPs  voted, including chairwoman Dame Emily Thornberry,    Lib Dems   committee. It   endorsed    Conservative members, Aphra Brandreth  Sir John Whittingdale,  said  UK should only back  move  part   wider -state solution   Israel-Palestinian conflict. It   unusual  select committees   split  controversial issues  they will normally   speak with  voice. The Tory MPs   foreign affairs committee made  unsuccessful attempt  change  report  reflect their views, arguing that recognition should accompany  release  hostages taken  Hamas  October 2023,   creation  Palestinian authorities without Hamas supporters. Around 60 MPs reportedly called   UK  immediately recognise Palestine   letter earlier this month, with London major Sir Sadiq Khan also making  call  Wednesday. In  statement  Thursday evening condemning "unspeakable  indefensible" conditions  Gaza, Sir Keir said statehood   "inalienable right". He reiterated  call   ceasefire   conflict, adding this would "    path" towards recognising  Palestinian state. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds  earlier said Labour ministers were "deeply committed"  recognition,  they wanted    "meaningful," adding: "At  minute, there    Palestinian state there".

'Not listening'

Spain, Ireland  Norway formally took  step last year, hoping  exert diplomatic pressure  secure  ceasefire  Gaza. Palestine currently  limited rights  participate   work   UN,   also recognised  various international organisations, including  Arab League. Sceptics argue recognition would largely   symbolic gesture unless questions over  leadership  extent   Palestine state  addressed first. In their report,  MPs acknowledged that  Israeli government "  listening   UK,"   only "sporadically" listening   United States,    most significant military backer. Speaking   BBC  Tuesday, former UK Foreign Office boss Lord McDonald argued recognition itself "doesn' really amount  very much," adding that  Palestine state lacked defined borders   "agreed government".

Aid distribution call

The report comes after  UK  27 other countries condemned  "drip feeding     inhumane killing  civilians" seeking food  water  Gaza. Israel' foreign ministry rejected  countries' statement, saying   "disconnected from reality  sends  wrong message  Hamas". In  rest  their report, which  endorsed unanimously,  MPs called   UN- system  distribute   Gaza, replacing  controversial US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)  place since May. They also said  UK should justify  "allowing indirect exports"  British parts  F-35 fighter jets used  Israel complies with  UK' obligations under international .

France' highest court  ruling  whether   strip Bashar -Assad,  former Syrian leader   exile  Russia,   immunity   head  state

French court  decide  Assad   stripped  immunity  tried  Syrian chemical attacks

BRUSSELS -- France' highest court  ruling Friday  whether   strip  head  state immunity  Bashar Assad,  former leader  Syria   exile  Russia, because   brutality   evidence  accusations against  collected  Syrian activists  European prosecutors.

If  judges   Cour  Cassation lift Assad' immunity,  could pave     trial  absentia over    chemical weapons  Ghouta  2013  Douma  2018,    precedent  allow  prosecution  other government leaders linked  atrocities, human rights activists  lawyers .

Assad  retained  lawyers  these charges   denied   behind  chemical attacks.

A ruling against Assad would  “ huge victory   victims,” said Mazen Darwish, president   Syrian Center  Media which collected evidence   crimes. “It’  only about Syrians, this will open  door   victims from  country  this will   first time that  domestic investigative judge   right  issue  arrest warrant   president during  rule.”

He said  ruling could enable  group  legally  after regime members, like launching  money laundering case against former Syrian Central Bank governor  Minister  Economy Adib Mayaleh, whose lawyers have argued   immunity under international .

For over 50 years, Syria  ruled  Hafez Assad  then   Bashar. During  Arab Spring, rebellion broke  against their tyrannical rule  2011 across  country  23 million, igniting  brutal 13-year civil  that killed more than half  million people, according   Syrian Observatory  Human Rights. Millions more fled  Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey  Europe. The Assad dynasty manipulated sectarian tensions  stay  power,  legacy driving renewed violence  Syria against minority groups despite promises that  country’  leaders will carve   political future  Syria that includes  represents   communities.

The ruling stripping Assad' immunity could   “significant precedent” that “could really   stage  potentially  other cases  national jurisdictions that strike down immunities," said Mariana Pena,  human rights lawyer   Open Society Justice Initiative, which helped bring  case  court.

As  International Criminal Court  issued arrests warrants  leaders accused  atrocities — like Vladimir Putin  Ukraine, Benjamin Netanyahu  Gaza,  Rodrigo Duterte   Philippines —  French judges’ ruling could empower  legal framework  prosecute  just deposed  exiled leaders  those currently  power.

The Syrian government denied  2013 that   behind  Ghouta attack,  accusation  opposition rejected  Assad’ forces were  only side   brutal civil   possess sarin. The United States subsequently threatened military retaliation,  Washington settled   deal with Moscow  Assad  give   chemical weapons’ stockpile.

Assad survived more than  decade longer, aided militarily  Russia  Iranian-backed proxies. Activists  human rights group accuse   using barrel bombs, torture,  massacres  crush opponents. But then  late 2024,  surprise assault  rebels swept into Aleppo  then Damascus, driving  dictator  flee   ally Russia  Dec. 8, 2024. While Darwish  others plan  press Interpol  Russia  extradite , they know   unlikely. But  arrest warrant issued  France could   groundwork   former dictator’ trial  absentia  potential arrest   travels outside Russia.

Any trial  Assad, whether  absentia    leaves Russia, would mean this evidence could then “ brought  light,” Pena said, including  enormous trove  classified  secret evidence amassed   judges during their investigations.

Syrians often took great personal risk  gather evidence   crimes. Darwish said that   aftermath   chlorine  attack  Douma,  example, teams collected eyewitness testimonies, images  devastation,  soil samples. Others then tracked down  interviewed defectors  build  “chain  command”   regime’ chemical weapons production  .

“We link  directly   president himself, Bashar -Assad,”  said.

Assad  relatively safe under international . Heads  state could   prosecuted  actions taken during their rule,  rule designed long   ease dialogue when leaders needed  travel  world  meet, said Jeanne Sulzer,  French lawyer  -  case against Assad   2013 chemical attack.

She said that kind  immunity  "almost  taboo" regardless   weight   charges. "You have  wait until  person    sitting  office   able  prosecute,”  said.

But that protection  been whittled away over  years  courts ruling that  brutality  Augusto Pinochet  Chile, Charles Taylor  Liberia,  Slobodan Milošević  Yugoslavia,  name just  , merited  restructuring   world' legal foundations, said James Goldston, executive director   Open Society Justice Initiative.

Syria today remains beholden  many awful legacies   Assad dynasty. Poverty, sectarianism, destruction,  violence still haunt  Syrian Arab Republic.

Damascus'  rulers  investigating nearly 300 people  crimes during several days  fighting  Syria' coast earlier this year. The interim authorities  Damascus have pledged  work with  United Nations  investigating further  crimes   Assad regime   civil . The global chemical weapons watchdog  called    government  interim president Ahmad -Sharaa  protect  dismantle Assad' stockpiles.

Darwish  working  29 cases against Assad  other regime figures  have fled  Russia,  Gulf, Lebanon  Europe. He said many Syrians hope Assad sits   fair trial  Syria.

“It should  done  Damascus,   need also    guarantees that  will have  fair trial even  this suspect,"  said.

His organization  already received requests  bring  court  crimes accusations against those involved  recent bloodshed  southern Syria.

“So anyone, whatever  name,   regime,  their authority,  will keep fighting this type  crime,” Darwish said.

ISTANBUL -- Iranian  European diplomats    meet  Istanbul Friday  embark   latest drive  unpick  deadlock over Tehran’ nuclear program.

Representatives from Britain, France  Germany, known   E3 nations, will gather   Iranian consulate building   first talks since Iran’ 12-  with Israel  June, which involved U.S. bombers striking nuclear-related facilities.

The talks  centered   possibility  reimposing sanctions  Iran that were lifted  2015  exchange  Iran accepting restrictions  monitoring   nuclear program.

The return  sanctions, known   “snapback” mechanism, “remains   table,” according   European diplomat speaking  condition  anonymity    sensitivity   talks.

“A possible delay  triggering snapback  been floated   Iranians   condition that there  credible diplomatic engagement  Iran, that they resume full cooperation with  IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency),  that they address concerns about their highly-enriched uranium stockpile,”  diplomat said.

European leaders have said sanctions will resume     August  there   progress  containing Iran’ nuclear program.

Tehran, meanwhile,  said  U.S., which withdrew from  2015 deal during President Donald Trump ’ first term, needs  rebuild faith   role  negotiations.

Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi said Iran’ engagement  dependent  “several  principles” that included “rebuilding Iran’ trust –  Iran  absolutely  trust   United States.”

In  social media post Thursday,  also said  talks shouldn’  used “  platform  hidden agendas such  military action.” Gharibabadi insisted that Iran’ right  enrich uranium “ line with  legitimate needs”  respected  sanctions removed.

Iran  repeatedly threatened  leave  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which commits   refrain from developing nuclear weapons,  sanctions return.

Friday’ talks will  held   deputy ministerial level, with Iran sending Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht- Ravanchi. A similar meeting  held  Istanbul  May. The identity   E3 representatives were  immediately clear   European Union’ deputy foreign policy commissioner  expected  attend.

The U.K., France  Germany were signatories   2015 deal, alongside  U.S., Russia  China. When  U.S. withdrew  2018, Trump insisted  agreement wasn’ tough enough. Under  original deal, neither Russia  China  veto reimposed sanctions.

Since  Israeli  U.S. strikes  Iran, which  American B-52 bombers  three nuclear sites, Iran’ Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi  accused  E3  hypocrisy, saying they failed  uphold their obligations while supporting Israel’ attacks.

Against  backdrop   conflict, which  Iran respond with missile attacks  Israel   strike   U.S. base  Qatar,  road ahead remains uncertain

While European officials have said they want  avoid further conflict   open   negotiated solution, they have warned that time  running .

Tehran maintains   open  diplomacy, though  recently suspended cooperation with  IAEA.

A central concern  Western powers  highlighted when  IAEA reported  May that Iran’ stockpile  uranium enriched  60% – just below weapons-grade level –  grown  over 400 kilograms (882 pounds).

In  interview with Al Jazeera that aired Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran  prepared  another   reiterated that  nuclear program will continue within  framework  international  while adding  country   intention  pursuing nuclear weapons.

A spokesman  Iran’ Atomic Energy Organization said Thursday  country’ nuclear industry would “grow back  thrive again” after  recent attacks  Israel   U.S.

For half  year , NASA' been weathering  storm  every front, from  budget   chain  command  potential program terminations. Employee uproar   inevitable chapter   saga.

A group  360 current  former NASA employees have penned  letter rebuking "rapid  wasteful changes" across staffing, mission  budgetary cuts   space agency.

"The last  months have seen rapid  wasteful changes which have undermined  mission  caused catastrophic impacts  NASA' workforce,"  letter says, noting concerns that  proposed downsizing  personnel  funding  "arbitrary  have been enacted  defiance  congressional appropriations "  that " consequences   agency   country alike  dire."

Signatories   letter, titled  Voyager Declaration, urge  U.S. leadership   implement "harmful" cuts  dispute "-strategic staffing reductions," curtailing research projects,  well  cancelling contracts  participation  international missions  assignments  which Congress  already appropriated funding. It'  small list  objections raised   time  broader uncertainty  NASA, which faces significant —  long chronicled — declines  funding  staff, amid  broader White House push  shrink down  federal workforce.

"NASA will never compromise  safety. Any reductions—including  current voluntary reduction—will  designed  protect safety-critical roles," NASA Spokesperson Bethany Stevens said   emailed statement. "The reality  that President Trump  proposed billions  dollars  NASA science, demonstrating  ongoing commitment  communicating  scientific achievements. To ensure NASA delivers   American people,   continually evaluating mission lifecycles,   sustaining outdated  lower-priority missions."

Adding   tumult, NASA  Monday announced  high-level exit  Makenzie Lystrup,  will   -year stint  Goddard Space Flight Center director  Aug. 1. NASA says  step  communicated internally before  knowledge   letter. It'   first loss from  agency' senior ranks  recent months: Laurie Leshin stepped down from  director post  NASA' Jet Propulsion Laboratory  June. And more exits could  forthcoming:   start   month, Politico reported that  least 2,145 senior-level employees could depart NASA, many serving  core mission sets.

Throughout, NASA — notable  both   achievements   substantial contracts   U.S. private space industry —  remained without long-term leadership, after U.S. President Donald Trump' initial pick, tech billionaire  Elon Musk ally Jared Isaacman,  unexpectedly removed from consideration back  May. Sean Duffy, Trump' transportation secretary,  appointed  hold   fort  NASA' interim administrator just this month.

Inevitably, there' money   line. NASA clinched  budget  $24.875 billion last year — 8.5% under  initial request  2% below  funding  2023 — that  matched  2025. Under  Trump administration,  agency battled  possibility   roughly 25% budget trim  2026, although  U.S. House  Appropriations subcommittee  pushed back  these cuts. If enacted,  Trump funding proposal  $18.8 billion would have been  smallest NASA budget since before  U.S.' first crewed Moon landing   Apollo 11 mission, commemorated this week  July 20.

Tesla' going through  bumpy ride.

The electric vehicle company  Wednesday reported  second consecutive quarter  declining auto sales. In Europe, Tesla' market share fell   sixth straight month  2.8%  June from 3.4%  year .

The Trump administration' plans  reportedly roll back  U.S.' push  cleaner vehicles will probably  Tesla further.

A $7,500 EV  credit   U.S. will expire     September, indirectly raising  cost  Tesla vehicles. Meanwhile, traditional carmakers will  longer need  purchase EV regulatory credits from Tesla — which receives them  free because  vehicles  completely electric —   Trump administration intends  stop fining traditional carmakers  missing emission standards. That means Tesla will soon lose  source  revenue.

They   things come  threes. Here'  last.

While Tesla' bitcoin holding  currently worth $1.24 billion, according   investor deck,  could have been worth billions more. In 2022,  company dumped 75%   bitcoin. The cryptocurrency  trading  roughly $118,000 . When Tesla sold  holdings,   trading  around $19,000.

If there'  consolation, even though U.S. President Donald Trump' " beautiful bill" will affect Tesla, Trump said  Thursday  wasn'  targeted measure. "I want Elon,   businesses within  Country,  THRIVE,  fact, THRIVE like never before!"

Whether Trump' sentiments  help pave  smoother road  Tesla, though,  another matter.

WASHINGTON -- The White House  eyeing redistricting efforts beyond Texas  help Republicans hold  U.S. House  2026 —  Democrats  preparing  escalate  response, with  senator vowing   “nuclear”  needed.

What’ shaping     multistate redistricting battle could mark  opening round  House control ahead  next year’ midterms, when Democrats  retaking  House   party' best chance  break Republicans' hold  Congress  President Donald Trump  determined  keep  GOP' majority. Democrats, under pressure from their base  match GOP tactics, have grown more forceful  their messaging   taking concrete steps  push back, even   party enters   disadvantage.

“If they’ going   nuclear, then   I,” said Sen. Elissa Slotkin. “They’ forcing  into this position because they’ trying  pick their voters.”

At Trump' urging, Texas Republicans  looking  redraw congressional maps  favor GOP candidates during  30- special legislative session that started this week. Trump  said  wants  carve  five  winnable GOP seats.

But Trump officials   going beyond just Texas, looking  redraw lines  other states such  Missouri, according   person familiar with conversations  unauthorized  speak publicly about them.

Democrats have fewer options. More   states  party controls   allow elected partisans  draw maps, instead entrusting groups such  independent commissions  draw fair lines.

Still, party leaders  exploring their legal options  shifting their posture. A party long known  believing '   moral high ground  signaling ' ready  fight dirty.

“We ’ fight with  hand behind  backs,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair   House Democratic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries  have fewer options  match Republicans,   hasn' stopped  from exploring them.

Earlier this month, Jeffries' team spoke with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul' office about redistricting after  news  Texas, according   person familiar with  conversations. Drawing  congressional lines  could  afoul   state constitution  undoubtedly draw legal challenges —   doesn’ appear     table.

“What I’ going   ,   fair  love  ,” Hochul said Thursday, adding that ’ “going   what  options .”

“If there’ other states that  violating  rules that  going    give themselves  advantage,  I’   I’ going  look   closely with Hakeem Jeffries.”

Jeffries   advisers have also examined legal strategies  other states with Democratic trifectas, including California, where  recently  with  state’ congressional delegation.

On Wednesday,  California delegation’ Democrats discussed  redistricting issue during  private meeting  Capitol Hill. And  Thursday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi joined  emergency call with others   state about  effort.

In  interview with The Associated Press, Pelosi said that       using redistricting outside   10-year window,   that’ what  party needs “ ,  will  that.”

“Everything    table,” Pelosi told AP.

California' governor, Gavin Newsom,  potential Democratic contender  president  2028,  taken  similar approach. He said  social media  response  Trump’ redistricting push that “  play this game.”

An independent commission handles redistricting   state. Newsom  floated  notion  California’ Democratic-controlled legislature doing  -decade redistricting, arguing  wouldn’  expressly forbidden   2008 ballot initiative that created  commission. He’ also mentioned  possibility  squeezing   special election  repeal  popular commission system before  2026 elections  underway, either  which would   long shot.

Beyond  behind--scenes maneuvering, Democrats   redistricting fight   opportunity  meet  moment politically — delivering  kind  aggressive pushback their voters have demanded.

Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego,   series  social media posts, pushed Democrats  fight back, saying  party should “gerrymander  help Democrats”  arguing they should dilute heavily Democratic districts  secure more seats “everywhere.”

“It’ time  Democrats  understand  existential threat. Republicans aren’ playing around  they will  this  long   takes  keep power,”  warned.

Gallego later told The Associated Press ’ simply about ensuring “that ’ also fighting back.”

That sentiment  gained traction beyond Congress. Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke said Sunday  CNN that Democrats need   “  absolutely ruthless about getting back  power.”

Next month, former President Barack Obama  heading  Martha’ Vineyard   fundraiser benefiting  National Democratic Redistricting Committee,  group whose nonprofit affiliate  filed  supported litigation  several states over GOP-drawn districts. Eric Holder, Obama’ former attorney general  chairs  outfit,  expected  attend, along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according   copy   invitation first reported  Politico.

In  statement  AP, Marina Jenkins, executive director   National Democratic Redistricting Committee, called Republicans’ moves “cheating,” adding that  group would  “using every single tool   disposal  fight back  stop Donald Trump’ scheme  steal  2026 midterm elections from voters.”

In addition  fundraisers like   featuring Obama next month, that tool  includes  group   affiliates focusing  organizing volunteers  donors around  special Texas session. They also make media appearances  craft digital campaigns  highlight their arguments.

Redrawing  congressional maps holds risks. During  2010s, Texas’ GOP-controlled Legislature redrew  congressional   bolster  party’ majority. But  advantage proved short-lived:  2018,  backlash  Trump’ presidency helped Democrats flip  seats that Republicans  assumed were safely .

“There    folks that drew these lines  everything that   very strong opinion  exactly where they ought  ,” said West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice,  Republican. “Now just  , 'OK, ’ going  redraw this, ' going  redraw that. And  ,  ' going  redraw, ' going  redraw.' I ' like that.”

Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said Thursday that     spoken   Republicans   state about redistricting  that '    Missouri legislature  governor  make  call.

“I' love  have more Republicans,” Hawley said.

On Wednesday, Tulsi Gabbard, director  national intelligence, from  White House Briefing Room podium, alleged  "yearslong coup  treasonous conspiracy" enacted   Obama administration against Trump.

But there wasn' much . In fact,  assessments  referenced largely affirm what' been known about Russian interference  years — while weaving  newly packaged  with that information.

From 'phony stuff'  'whatever' credible'  'unverified hearsay,'  pattern emerges

The Wall Street Journal reported that Bondi   deputy,  told  president  name    files multiple times, said they felt  files contained "unverified hearsay."

Note  saying whatever  "credible." He' used  word "credible"  this story multiple times   last 10 days.

Here'  sampling:

"Well, I think   case  Epstein, they' already looked    they  looking  ,  I think  they have      anything credible," Trump said   interview   same   Real America' Voice,  conservative media outlet. "But  know, that     Biden administration  four years. I  imagine what they  into files."

Before take :

"[T] credibility  very important," Trump said. "And  want credible evidence  something like that. And I think  attorney general' handled  very well."

He  also asked  Bondi briefed  about  name being   files —  this  days before  Wall Street Journal report.

"No, ,"  said before adjusting  language, "She' given  just  very quick briefing,   terms   credibility   different things that they' seen. And I would  that,  know, these files were made   Comey.

He continued: "I think well, really, only pretty  people, including fake news, want  keep something like that going.

But credible information,  ' give . Anything that' credible. I would   them have ."

That tracks with what Trump said during  presidential campaign last year, despite  impression that many   base were left with — that  would release  files.

Of course, releasing "credible" information   important reason,  example,  grand jury testimonies remain sealed with  exceptions —  protect witnesses   integrity  investigations.

Despite   controversies Trump  faced   political career, this    hasn' been able  talk    . That' particularly true because this   story influential people   base have pushed —  some  them     administration directly responsible  handling this.

What  White House  tried   hasn' satisfied many, including   base —  could make  headaches  swing-district Republicans

Fearing coverage could change, some parents rush  vaccinate their kids

For  decades, Washington, D.C., pediatrician Lanre Falusi  counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects  timing. But this year,  said,  conversations have changed.

"For  first time, I' having parents  newborns    their baby will still  able   vaccines," Falusi said.

This story  produced  partnership with KFF Health News.

Throughout  U.S., pediatricians  anxious parents  concerned about access  routine childhood immunizations.

That' especially true  those with children covered  Medicaid,  government insurance program  -income families  people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4  10 children   United States.

"It really became  issue when RFK Jr. stepped into  role  HHS secretary," said Deborah Greenhouse,  pediatrician  South Carolina.

The concern accelerated after  shake-    Centers  Disease Control  Prevention vaccine advisory body  June, raising fears that millions  American families could soon have     pocket  shots  covered  their health insurance.

Health  Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,  longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed  17 members   CDC' Advisory Committee  Immunization Practices (ACIP),  panel responsible  recommending which shots  included   nation' adult  childhood immunization schedules.

Kennedy replaced  panelists with  members aligned with  views, prompting alarm among medical professionals  public health experts.

Insurance uncertainty worries parents

"People should  worried about what' going  happen   availability  vaccines  children," said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director   Program  Medicaid   Uninsured  KFF,  national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Under  Affordable Care Act, health insurers  required  cover  ACIP-recommended vaccines.

ACIP' recommendations also determine which vaccines  covered   Vaccines  Children Program,  CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations  -income  uninsured children. Half  children   U.S.  eligible   VFC Program.

If   ACIP members withdraw support   particular vaccine   CDC director agrees, Tolbert said,  consequences would  immediate.

"It would automatically affect what  covered  therefore which vaccines  available  children  Medicaid,"  said.

Health insurance companies have   said  they would alter coverage,  Tolbert said such  move would open  door  private insurers  refuse  cover  vaccine.

Pediatricians worry about  future where parents might have  choose:  hundreds  dollars   pocket  shots  leave their kids unprotected.

The health insurance industry group AHIP said that health plans "continue  follow federal requirements related  coverage  ACIP-recommended vaccines  will continue  support broad access  critical preventive services, including immunizations."

Pediatricians  news about President Trump'  budget , which  expected  reduce Medicaid spending  about $1 trillion over  next decade,  also prompted questions from parents.

While parents   worried about losing their Medicaid,   doesn' mention vaccines  change eligibility  benefits  children' Medicaid, Tolbert said.

But less federal funding means states will have  make decisions about   covered  which services  offered.

To raise  revenue needed    Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked  other spending, such  education  corrections; , more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.

"And they   that  cutting eligibility  optional populations   cutting services that  optional,   reducing payments  providers   form  provider rates," Tolbert said. "It' unclear  this will play ,   will likely look different across  states."

In May, Kennedy announced   post  X that  CDC   longer recommending  COVID-19 vaccine  healthy children  pregnant women. The move prompted  lawsuit   American Academy  Pediatrics  other physician groups that seeks  freeze Kennedy' directive.

And  June,   ACIP members appointed  Kennedy voted  recommend that adults  children  longer receive  vaccines with thimerosal,  preservative rarely used  some  vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have rallied against thimerosal  decades, alleging links  autism despite  evidence   association.

"There   cause  concern," Department  Health  Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said   statement. "As Secretary Kennedy  stated,   will  denied access   licensed vaccine  they choose  receive ."

"When  ACIP committee  last month, they reaffirmed that  vaccines will remain accessible  covered,  they emphasized safety  ensuring these vaccines  mercury-free," Hilliard wrote.

"The Vaccines  Children (VFC) program continues  provide COVID-19 vaccines   cost  eligible children when  parent, provider,  patient decide vaccination  appropriate. Medicaid will continue  reimburse  administration ."

In Falusi' practice, parents  scheduling appointments  coincide precisely with their child' eligibility, sometimes making appointments  same week  their birthdays.

The news that Columbia University will  more than $200 million   federal government comes after several investigations  months  negotiations with  Trump administration.

The settlement announced  Wednesday restores Columbia' access  some $1.3 billion  federal funding – resuming frozen grants  opening  opportunities  future research. And  university agreed  take steps  curb antisemitism   campus.

Here' what  know about  details:

The money

Columbia agreed    $200 million fine   federal government, over three years. The university agreed    additional $21 million  settle  investigation launched  March   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into claims  workplace harassment based  religion.

No admissions  fault

Columbia   admit   wrongdoing,   university said  does  agree that  violated Title VI   Civil Rights Act   handling  allegations  antisemitism. The settlement agreement "   admission  whole   part  either party,  Columbia expressly denies liability regarding  United States' allegations  findings."

However,   letter yesterday  faculty  students, Columbia' acting president, Claire Shipman, noted that Columbia  "recognized, repeatedly, that Jewish students  faculty have experienced painful, unacceptable incidents,  that reform    needed."

Antisemitism

Shipman acknowledged " very serious  painful challenges  institution  faced with antisemitism." She pledged  "work  multiple fronts  combat  forms  hatred  intolerance  Columbia,   will  more efforts  that    coming months."

The settlement commits Columbia  follow through  earlier commitments, including:

Naming  faculty members "with joint positions  both  Institute  Israel  Jewish Studies   departments  fields  economics, political science"   university' School  International  Public Affairs (SIPA).

Amending  antidiscrimination policies  include  definition  antisemitism used   International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

Naming coordinators  respond  antisemitism allegations,    administrator  serve   liaison  students  advise  "ways  improve   support Jewish students."

Provide additional university-wide training  antisemitism.

Reaffirming Columbia' zero tolerance policy  discrimination  harassment.

Restoring frozen funds

The Trump administration  frozen  placed  hold " majority"   $1.3 billion  federal funding, Shipman said. "With  agreement,"  noted, " access  billions  dollars  federal research funding will resume."

The settlement restores payments  research grants  government  frozen,  well  some contracts  government  terminated (those from  National Institutes  Health   Department  Health  Human Services,    Education Department  other government agencies). And  makes Columbia eligible once again  future grants, contracts  awards.

"Not only will this resolution restore Columbia' ability  fully participate   longstanding federal research partnerships," Shipman said, "  also will ensure critical continuity  faculty, students,  staff across every discipline."

Academic freedom

Shipman argued that  agreement preserves Columbia' academic independence. "The federal government will  dictate what  teach,  teaches,  which students  admit,"  said.

Not everyone agreed with that assessment.

"This announcement   devastating blow  academic freedom  freedom  speech  Columbia," said Todd Wolfson, president   American Association  University Professors.

Admissions  Hiring

The settlement says that  government will have  authority over "faculty hiring, university hiring, admissions decisions,   content  academic speech."

But Columbia  agree  some   government' demands. The university will   "race, color, ,  national origin"  hiring decisions "across  schools, departments,  programs."

The university vowed  keep  admissions policies merit-based  promised   "unlawfully preference applicants based  race, color,  national origin  admissions."

DEI

Columbia agreed  " maintain programs that promote unlawful efforts  achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets,  similar efforts,"   comply with existing antidiscrimination laws.

Compliance

The agreement establishes procedures  arbitration when there  disputes,  creates  independent "resolution monitor." That process, Shipman said, "requires that  government  through  very specific, prescribed   steps   believes    meeting  terms   agreement."

For  long time  climate politics,  question  been: What path   need     avert absolute catastrophe? And     —    have  chance  being  ? The   here,   past couple  years  America,   Inflation Reduction Act. $370 billion —  largest renewable energy investment ever —  build  infrastructure  decarbonization. To build solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles   much more. Was   much  climate advocates hoped? No. Was  more than ’ ever done before? Yeah,   . And    been gutted   “, beautiful bill.” I ’ want windmills destroying  place. I ’ want these solar things, where they   miles  they cover   half  mountain that  ugly  hell. So what path    ? And what does climate politics need  learn from this loss? Are  just courting catastrophe? Or   actually still have  shot? To   help  answer these questions, I wanted  have   people  were involved  just   Inflation Reduction Act,  just   lobbying effort against  “ beautiful bill,”    doing really important work  both  modeling   politics side    figure  where  climate movement goes from here. Jesse Jenkins   professor  Princeton. He leads  ZERO   campus. And with  teams,   been    leading climate modelers trying  figure   much these policies will actually . Jane Flegal   executive director  Blue Horizons Foundation,     member   Biden administration’ climate policy team. As always,  email: ezrakleinshow@nytimes.. Jane Flegal, Jesse Jenkins, welcome   show. Thanks Good   back. Thanks  having . So, Jane,  worked   Inflation Reduction Act’ clean energy investments incentives  part   Biden administration. So I think  place  begin : What were  most important parts  that bill from your perspective? So    climate  concerned, I think there   broad buckets  interventions that  Inflation Reduction Act made. One    policy  that bill. There   technology neutral clean electricity  credit, both  production  investment  clean energy technologies that  extended basically into perpetuity until, well,   long time. But what  unique about that  historically,    these fits  starts  very short term  credit incentives  solar  wind that kept expiring  then coming back   renewal. And ’ have  legislative fight  should they  extended  . Which  that kind  uncertainty    environment  which private capital  make smart decisions about investing  energy technologies. So  IRA, really rationalized  clean energy  credit scheme  making  technology neutral. So ’  just solar  wind, ’  zero emissions technology from solar  wind  geothermal  nuclear could qualify. There  also  subsidies  purchase  electric vehicles, which accounted  very significant chunk  emissions reductions  advanced manufacturing. So building factories   United States, states  build  component parts that make  these clean energy technologies. So  series  subsidies essentially  investment  production  clean energy technologies. That  thing . And thing    series  grant programs which   some ways  charismatic, charismatic megafauna   bill because ’ like, discrete grants going  discrete projects  across  country,  vague  interventions that  unleashing  could   example  this charismatic, charismatic megafauna. There . There   grant program called  greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund  EPA that funded really incredible install solar panels   roof   school   disadvantaged community, which  like  great thing    lots  reasons. But   compare  emissions impact  even   total    those grant projects  what  anticipate  emissions impact  subsidizing solar power   private sector  deploy  scale, ’ basically ’  even close. The  subsidies   more  bend  curve  emissions reductions. So, Jesse,      modeling   Inflation Reduction Act. So what were  targets  were trying    where were . In terms  whether  were  pace   them prior   B.B.B.? Yeah, I mean,  basic target ’ trying       greenhouse  emissions   point where whatever ’ emitting  being canceled   some kind  removal  carbon dioxide from  atmosphere  other greenhouse gases. That’   zero target. President Biden  that target  2050     zero,  then   interim target  cutting emissions  half   peak levels  2030. Our estimates were that from  repeat project, which I , were that  Inflation Reduction Act,  infrastructure  that passed under  Biden administration  then    regulatory policies that they also implemented collectively would have gotten  about half   . So   kind   steps forward. Now ’ taking   step back. But  should have been taking four steps forward   were  track  those kinds  targets. So I want  slow this down. So  were   Inflation Reduction Act  paper would have gotten  halfway  Joe Biden’ goal,  Inflation Reduction Act   other   bills,  kind  full total  policies Biden would have gotten  halfway  Biden’ goal. So then  were actually implementing this. What matters    words   page,    actually building solar panels. Are  building wind turbines? How  deployment implementation going. You’ been tracking this. So  solar ’ been going solar  batteries have been smashing  records each year since  IRA passed. And  that’ going  intended. Wind power  continuing  struggle   back even  record levels that  reached  circa 2020, when  built about gigawatts  year  wind. That’ enough , I ’ about 10 million households, I guess,  year. We  only building about   gigawatts  year ,  like half  that level,  have been making pretty good progress  electric vehicle adoption. And there  have seen  pretty substantial degree  market transformation. When  IRA passed,   basically just Tesla. That  . Now  have  pretty competitive broad   entries, dozens  different vehicles   market. Some  those have  reached  point where they’  least profitable  paper. Like GM. That’   threshold   . And I think just  societal penetration  EVs    much higher level. Now ’ probably everybody knows somebody that   electric vehicle   seen them driving around. And I think there’  long term indelible impact  that degree  penetration. So those  going relatively close   track basically with what  were modeling. I think EVs   little  slower than intended, partly because Tesla  become   controversial. And ’  selling  many  they intended. What happened there. Yeah  then wind  been falling behind while solar kind  picks     that Slack. All right. So that’ where  were prior    election. Yeah Donald Trump wins  election. In great news  climate. He becomes very close with Elon Musk  runs  electric vehicle company. So green shoots there. You    beautiful bill. What does that   that   programs. What  gone. What  left  what  problems have emerged. So And Jesse,  should jump  here because ’   weeds probably more than anyone I know. But  most significant damage  that bill  clean energy   solar  wind, specifically, where they were  Republicans. The Republicans were quite punitive, actually, really shortened  timeline  solar  wind. Anyone ’ tried  build  large scale piece  energy infrastructure will tell   work  time   even  commence construction takes years. I mean, ’  very long process. So that’ what  means  that  incentive   longer sending  long term signal   market that there will  incentives  them  build. Instead,  have this  rush. So ’ just decided   best  , wreck  solar  wind industries going forward. I mean, they even tried   beyond that with  initial Senate draft, adding     wind  solar. Excise      just ending  Tax Cuts that basically lowered  cost  wind  solar  somewhere between 30 percent  percent. So ’ just raised taxes percent  wind  solar,  biggest forms  New electricity generation. They actually proposed  excise     that  further penalize wind  solar beyond 2027. That    least removed   last minute,     there   very strong  concerted effort from  kind  ideological contingent   Republican Party that  into     more pragmatic contingent   party that  like, , wait  minute. We electricity demand  growing rapidly. These technologies  contributing   supply. They’ keeping energy costs . They’ driving investment   districts. We ’ want   this  immediately. Over 20 house members, half  dozen senators standing   defend  credits implemented   partisan, Democrat only budget bill, vocally  repeatedly, multiple letters   president telling them    that. And  I  think there  factions  play here. And unfortunately  ideological contingent   there. What  Jane. The ideological contingent. I know  were involved   mobilization around defeating  added   wind  solar. What  even  argument  taxing wind  solar specifically. Yeah We will  taxes  corporations,  specifically fossil fuel subsidies. But specifically,   want  build wind turbines   down solar panels,  face   . The people arguing  that,   they even   they   justify . O.K   I think  thing that I have learned throughout this process  that climate politics  inseparable from    other politics. So going back   election, I think part  what happened here   passed  IRA   purely Democratic. It   Democrat only bill. So  live   world  that ’ quite familiar with where when that happens  there   tendency  turn   polarization  whatever   whatever    demo. Bill, right  with  other side   aisle. So I  think this bill  framed  Biden’ signature climate achievement. It’   some  surprising that  Republicans wanted  tear  down. Just wind  solar became culture , political culture  issues. I think  some degree electric vehicles  well, which also have their  credits. The  cuts  EVs  September 30  this year  well, which  even shorter than  initial proposal. So   debate went , that  shorter  shorter. So   credits  wind, solar,  EVs  gone. It’ gone. What’ left. Lots  stuff actually. President Trump,      authority  that party, called  full repeal   Green New Scam. That   what happened. So I just I  think that’  important thing, because I’ devoted  entire life  climate. That would have been  unthinkable outcome   even four years ,    told  Dems pass  Dem only climate bill. Trump tells everyone  repeal  full thing   significant chunk survives. So  mentioned that they tried  rationalize  clean energy  incentive program  allowing. Any zero emissions technology  qualify. Basically,  technology that  claim that   0 emissions still   this production  investment  credit  clean energy. And through  long term, through    20, commencing construction through    2033, they    full credit. And then  steps down over  couple more years. So basically Republicans just endorsed  decade long  credit  carbon free electricity, just  wind  solar. Just because I think this will  confusing  people. Oh,  ’    wind  solar cannot  . Not everything,  wind  solar. Any nuclear plant,  advanced geothermal plant. If fission  fusion works, that will qualify. So I’ generally found this    puzzling part  Republican energy policy, which  I  almost understand   matter  culture ,    fossil fuel energy  against renewables, clean energy. But there seems    particular loathing  wind  solar,    same time somewhat   embrace,  least  openness  nuclear, which I kind   because    environmentalists ’ like . So maybe  Republicans  like . But then more technology forward, less mature technologies, advanced geothermal, green hydrogen,  cetera fusion, those have maintained  kind  neutrality   political  here. Is that basically accurate. I think that’ basically true. And I think  reasons  . So  culture  stuff  . I think   worth noting that part   reason there   larger target  solar  wind  because they  mature. They  pretty mature technologies that  being widely deployed because  makes economic sense. So those  credits look expensive. As  matter  fiscal scoring. Whereas  credits  more innovative technologies tend   look expensive because   thinks they’ going   built   next 10 years. Well, also then  steel ,  Republican position here  goes something. There’  version   that goes something like this. Wind  solar  more mature technologies. They ,  virtually  measure,  competitive with other forms  energy. EVs  fairly mature technology. If  wanted cheaper electric vehicles,  ’ need   credit. We could just open  borders  Chinese electric vehicles. Republicans  certainly keen  doing, which they ’ want  . But  argument  basically    need  subsidize these technologies. Why  that wrong   that wrong. I think   wrong  Jesse  jump into. But I there  having abundant electrons that     fuel economic growth  meet rising demand  energy   United States, which  happening   first time  decades,   public good. We subsidize  kinds  energy development because  know that  robust  large  abundant energy system  good  economic growth. It underpins  entire economy. And ’ good   national security. So there even   didn’ care about climate change, given that solar  particular solar  batteries   most rapid    many cases,  most cost effective   meet growing demand, there’ absolutely  public argument  subsidizing this stuff, even  ’ relatively mature. In  same ,  subsidize  kinds  things that  relatively mature because they’ good  society. Then,  course,  argument  most Republicans will  deny that climate change   problem. I mean, some ,  many Republicans  will acknowledge climate change   problem. They’ just argue   different kind  solution  than Democrats. If  believe climate change   problem, then ’ subsidizing  just  public good  abundant energy that’ affordable,  also  climate benefit. What   solution . I    fair  Republicans  this show,  I have  heard many Republicans arguing  something that would qualify    solution   climate change. So when   that, what   thinking. I mean, I think insufficiently ambitious  sure. But  IIJA,  bipartisan infrastructure  actually contained  fair amount  investments  clean energy technologies that Republicans supported. So clean hydrogen hubs, direct  capture spending, spending  storage,  fair amount  carbon capture  fair amount  technology investment   more kind  innovation oriented view, where  gets much harder   anything that  very seriously about deploying mature, clean energy technologies  scale  regulatory mandates that would achieve that  / restrict fossil fuels. Yeah I mean, I think there’  challenge here, which  that what   from  Republican Party  they tend  support  technologies that  less mature. And   argue that that’  rational technology policy strategy. There’  case   supporting innovative technologies  they mature  come down  cost. And I’ supported that case  years. But there’ also I worry that  reason they’ doing that  because they’   direct threat  incumbent energy industries. So what  driving down consumption  gasoline   adoption  electric  hybrid vehicles. What  driving down  consumption  natural    United States   growth  wind  solar   power sector. And  when they become large competitive threats, then  have different factions within  Republican Party standing   defend     industry, channeling  advice from donors  politically connected folks  those industries    attack their competitors. You have  ideological culture  element  this that well,  liberals like these technologies,  have  hate them. And  this case, unfortunately, I think Donald Trump  much more strongly aligned with  culture  piece    probably   more susceptible  input from  fossil fuel aligned donors  members,  that   over  more pragmatic bloc. So  thing that  part   whole political theory   Inflation Reduction Act   were going  pull   this investment  factories  clean energy,  that  both going  generate economic activity,   going  generate jobs. And   seem some  that investment  coming forward. So what   achieve  that. And then what   think will happen  those factories. People were planning  those people  were getting hired. Yeah, ’  great question. I mean, there  been more than $100 billion worth  investment  clean energy related supply chains  factories   Uc   result   IRA. Much  that  already started   built,   EV investment  been huge, with  US  investing, China   other countries  2024. Like this  working   supply chain underscoring. Yeah   global competitiveness context  were mounting  competitive defense. And  that’ being undermined  these policies like  45X  credit. The  credit  manufacturing   sustained  sustained. Which tells  something about ’ broadly popular. That’ true. But  Jessie’ point,  demand pull   thing,  widgets   manufacturing  totally taken away. The demand pull being  subsidies  subsidies  EVs. So like actually Rhodium Group found that US demand  EVs  2030, when most   manufacturing  online, will  less than half  what   before this Republican bill because   termination   EV  credits   rollback   clean vehicle regulations. If demand totally craters   products these factories   being incentivized  produce,  ’ need them anymore. It’ entirely plausible that  have . And I  think part   reason  fivex  manufacturing  credits stuck around  because people    very discreetly tied    credit,  they wanted  save that  credit  those factories. But industrial strategy   just about  supply side. It’ about  other stuff. This   place where what happened   last couple  months just feels  strange  . So Elon Musk becomes  close  Trump that  seems like  -president   early weeks  months   administration, when liberal protesters want  target  right wing coalition’ great vulnerability. They begin protesting outside Tesla distributors. Donald Trump does like  Tesla infomercial   lawn   White House. They still keep    policy wrecking  EV credits. And ,  course, whether ’ because  that  , I’ skeptical. That’  Musk broke with Trump. But , obviously, Musk    outs  saying ’ start  America party. But they almost seem like this moment where  there could have been  good thing    Elon Musk Donald Trump alliance,  would have been Trump’ softening    electric vehicles. Musk selling electric vehicles  Republicans. But instead, ’ like  Republican antipathy  electric vehicles  much stronger than  Trump Musk alliance. And that’  thing that held. It also  true that Elon  , that Musk   advocating  retaining  EV. Yes that’  I ’ believe that’ what shattered their relationship. Musk seemed perfectly willing  light Tesla  fire. Whatever else  want   about Elon Musk’ politics, Tesla  America’ most capable national champion  electric vehicles. It   world leading, world beating company,  only globally competitive company. But    destroyed  reputation among  people    cars here   Europe. So when  think about what’ going  happen   most capable American manufacturer  electric vehicles versus  Chinese think these manufacturers, ’ like  doesn’ have support from Trump. It  lost support among liberals here  again  Europe. And ’ getting crushed  competition  China. I mean, ’ getting crushed  China. And  Chinese cars  good. Yeah Yeah they’ right. They’  good. We ’  them  here because ’ terrified that  would just take over  market functionally, instantly. If   them  here, they would   cheapest electric cars   market. That’ right. Yeah,   good margin. And  ’ just ended this whole Elon Musk Donald Trump saga with  American  much weaker position. Yeah, I mean,    central industries  were trying  compete with China . Exactly I mean, I like    talk about  tough Trump   China, Biden  left  EV system   much stronger position,  Trump  Musk collaborated  destroy . Absolutely I mean, beyond  depressing   step backwards    climate side. And this   other I think,  lasting legacy  this bill. I mean, there’  kinds  other anti-china provisions that they threw into   other  credits  haven’ talked about. Now have  basically demonstrate that there’  Chinese content  your supply chain      remaining  credits that persisted. But  ’ compete globally  just throwing  walls  Chinese influence  Chinese competition. You have  actually have  domestic competitiveness strategy. And there ’  right . We’ talked about  ways  which this bill gutted when solar electric vehicles. What   bill   what have been other Trump administration moves  actually accelerate  construction  fossil fuel infrastructure    help coal, right. Is there anything   other side  that ledger. There’  real wackadoodle coal thing   GOP bill. GOP , which  there    production  credit  metallurgical coal, which  really nonsensical  just about every front. Not least because  ’ concerned about China /  domestic steel industry. Metallurgical coal    large exported, much  which  exported  China. You want   what metallurgical coal . It’ coal that’ used mostly  industrial processes,  power generation, largely steel production. So    subsidizing American metallurgical coal   shipped  China. So they  make cheap  dirty steel, which they dump  global markets. That undercuts American steel producers. I mean, this    means  worst thing  this  , terrible bill. But   still   just  glaring example   backwards  policy    much   corporate giveaway     last 48 hours. It’  tiny subsidy. It’ 2.5 percent  ’ only  place    years. So   absolutely  going  affect  investment decisions  expand US metallurgical coal production. It’ just  straight giveaway  whoever owns those coal mines. And  ’ subsidizing coal production while raising taxes  clean energy production. It’ hard  swallow that  sure. You said earlier that  IRA   other,  associated legislation,    percent   interim  zero target. Just beautiful language here. What does  model  . So  estimates that  under  current Biden  policies, ’  track    about 40  43 percent below peak emissions levels. Now ’ probably going     order  20 percent  24 percent below  2030,  maybe closing   28 percent  2035. So  about half. So  about half   progress that ’ made. That’ actually helpful. And  I actually   thing here without repeating talking points that sometimes climate deniers  delayers ,   absolutely important that  US reduces  emissions very rapidly. It’  moral imperative. It’ important  demonstrating   world that  developed economy  decarbonize without major sacrifice. That  important, that leadership  important,   US  going   like 13 percent  emissions. All   emissions  going  come from  OECD economies that  developing. So    think about  US’ role  addressing climate   actually take  step back  think, ’  just about  decreasing decreasing  emissions  rapidly  possible. That   important piece  . But  investments   innovative technologies that  going  represent 40 percent   global emissions reductions,   have  policy framework   US  those more innovative technologies where  have  opportunity  actually lead  innovating, building  deploying those things. And importantly, diffusing them internationally. So like I   little I   little about  modeling anyway. I mean, I love Jesse  ’ important,  sure  . I   little. It’ also  model over here. Yeah like O.K. Enough   I  think  I  think  I’ been thinking   about  debates about Democratic politics  strategy, there’ been    conversation about impulses   coalition toward maximalism. And climate  this thing where   been framed   physical, scientific problem, where there  hard limits. If    fully solve  problem     zero emissions   there  some deadline,  there  some deadline,    next 10 years,   ’ keep  1  1/2 degrees,  planet’ going  fall   cliff. That   scientifically incorrect. It  true that there  uncertainties   climate system,  every degree  warming every fraction   degree  warming that  ’, that  ’ cause matters. It matters     risks  climate change. And  I   little I kind think that there’    which  framed this such that  encourages that kind  impulse among  Democratic Party   ’   nothing. Progress   worth considering because  have  solve this problem completely   next five years   planet  doomed. That  just  true. And that also contributes, I think,   mindset that ’ just suffered this  political loss. It’  truly substantive step backwards. Some people interpret that, well,  ’ done. Like ’ lost. It’ over like there’ nothing   . We’ going     time. And that’    works. Well,        I understood  targets, because ’  course right that every degree matters. There   / switch  climate risk. But   that this  been talked about almost universally within  climate movement, what I understood, Biden’  zero targets  ,  what I understood   your modeling  mean,  that  scientific community, however  want  define that,  looked     models, looked     research,  described zones that   really frightening levels  climate risk. No, that’ actually  what  science says. And ’  huge  great  talk about this because  that’  communication failure,  sounds    little  like I ’ tell  difference here between every degree matters. And  have been scaring   unscientifically  decades  order     move faster. But  that ’ moving slower, ’ worry  much. We were just   clear, I wasn’ scaring people with that kind  rhetoric. So  science  very clear. Get there  fast  possible. We’ already seeing dangerous climate change around  today. So  idea that there’ some safe zone  some dangerous zone  there’  threshold between    just  scientifically true. And  IPCC  never said that there’  consensus   scientific documents that frame  that . What they’ said  that every degree involves increasing risk. And that’ true. And   have  sense  urgency. We want  make  much progress  possible,  rapidly  possible. But that’ what  science says. And  possible. Part That’ what politics  technology  society have  determine. And there’ No science that says what that , right. That’  US trying  hash this   muddle through  best  . Well, there  social science. Well, I  this    . Well, give   social science perspective, Jane. Well, I mean, I think   that I’ been thinking about this lately, because   what Jesse said  right. And    reasons that I remain very anxious about climate risk  because there     uncertainty   climate system. There  things  ’  understand  world. While   true that  emissions trajectories seem   improving relative  what they thought  would ,  I   more about that   minute. How  climate will respond  those emissions  importantly, what  potential  positive, which  actually negative feedback loops   climate system might ,  tipping points, which  another   concerns. There     uncertainty about those things. And ’ scary. And  ’ know. But  point  that  ’ know where they , where they . So I’ been thinking about    race between feedback loops, kind . It’ like  race. It’  race  like  negative feedback,  positive   feedback loops   climate system   feedback loops that ’ been trying  cultivate politically, where ’ driving down  cost  technologies, deploying more technologies, building political will. And that’  problem. I think that’    nutshell. When  said  minute , I want  make sure  ’ forget this, that   seeing somewhat better outcomes than  might have feared Yes At  levels  warming that ’ currently experiencing. Just expand. What does that mean. I most people haven’ heard that. Yeah what I actually mean   that  impacts  better than  thought, ’ that  emissions themselves    high   predicted them  . That’ largely because ’ seen such rapid cost declines  these technologies  wide scale deployment  these technologies. The world  decarbonizing faster than  thought that  would   climate   responding   ways that  predicted that  would. When    climate’  responding, ’ referring   fact that things have been extraordinarily . Yeah things  warming much more rapidly. And this  where     Zeke   show. But there’ lots   father, ’  excellent climate modeler. So ’ trying  figure  what’ causing that more that more rapid warming climate response. But  thing that   definitely control  bending  bending  emissions trajectory down, which ’ been more successful  than  thought  would . All right. So there’ another then dimension    world  changing. That seems important here. So Jesse  I used  talk   about  basic theory  decarbonization  ’ going  electrify everything   possibly electrify. That’ going  mean  need   more electricity. We’ going  hopefully generate that electricity using clean sources,  then ’ going   down  bunch  transmission lines   that electricity where ’ going  need  . When people modeled  much electricity  would need they were thinking about  trends  they existed  2015  2018  2020,   AI  become this absolutely massive consumer  electricity. So   that changed  amount  electricity   projecting that  will need   next 5, 10 years. So  latest estimate  when  account   reduced electrification      these  cuts  heat pumps   EVs  other things    Republican  bill   addition  data centers  AI   forecasts, ’ expecting electricity demand  grow   sustained rate  about 2 percent  year over  next decade. That’ enough  increase   about 25 percent through 2035 from current levels. That’    additional electricity. So that’ more than  entire nuclear fleet, additional generation know that’  demand growth,  which AI  probably about  quarter  that. And  ’  ’  added trend. And ’ increasing  power sector when  comes  decarbonization, which  twofold. It’  both meet   that demand growth with clean electricity sources,   ’   deeper hole while simultaneously reducing  reliance  fossil fuels  power generation. We’ still going   that,    much   thought. In fact,  estimates  that ’ going  lose about  nuclear fleet’ worth  clean generation. That would have been added. If ’ sustained  cuts  wind  solar through 2035. That goes away. However, ’ still going   wind  solar meet most  that demand growth, probably     . It’ just that ’  going    deeply into  existing coal fleet. So   nutshell,  more expensive than  would have been    retained  credits   IRA, where  were basically taxing  cheapest  most widely deployed energy supply. The  other thing about  demand, though, that’ worth noting, that’ different about  broader economy wide  electrification demand   I demand  going  happen fast like that. That  like that’ like near-term demand consumption   city scale   spot,  opposed  EVs, which  diffused over wide areas. It’  particular challenge   grid, particularly  transmission  distribution. Grids need   people    nerds  energy. Not    ,    tell  that they  worried  about  grid being able  hold , that they’ worried   next 5, 10 years about outages, about blackouts, about different kinds  grid failures, because ’ adding  much  such  different kind  electricity demand. Like,    think about that interaction between  grid  have   energy ’ about  need. And I think that’ certainly  risk. I mean, ’ going   demand growing rapidly. If  ’ grow supply rapidly enough, then  risk  twofold. One, energy prices  going    because supply   keeping pace with demand,   risk  outages goes  because  might have  normal demands . But  things    sample,    extreme heat wave   extreme cold event  something like that happens. We have  less Slack   system  absorb that   haven’ added enough  supply. What ’ basically what  Republicans have basically done  ensure that ’ going  deploy less  electricity, that   electricity  deploy  more expensive. And that because  that,  rely more  existing coal   plants that weren’ otherwise used. So ’ going   paying more   clean electricity  paying more   dirty  power plants  raising  risk that ’  able  keep  with demand growth. All because  ’ ’ raised taxes   most important sources  New electricity. You gestured  this  minute ,  ’ been talking   about  effect   this  decarbonization. What about  effect   energy bills people . Yeah I mean, this  really quite brutal. I ’ know  I have  numbers      head,  there have been  bunch  analyses that electricity, large electricity buyers  others have done. Independent analysts   impact  electricity rates associated with repeal   IRA. And they  significant  they vary across  country. But  some cases I think ’   order  like 15 percent  average,  15 percent increase  retail bills. But  course, that   2 percent  some states  30 percent  other states. Some   states quite substantial 30. I mean, ’ really quite . And ’   moment,  where affordability  cost  living  quite   mind  those   present,  also  everybody. The other thing that’ going  happen, though,  ’ because ’ deploying less electric vehicles, ’ going  consume more gasoline  nationally  diesel,  that’ going  drive  prices   pump . The estimates  that could    order   5 percent increase  gasoline prices. So another   think about   that Republicans just voted   5 percent   rate  slowing  deployment  EVs, right. And  none  this stuff makes good economic sense, even   ’ care about climate, especially   care about  affordability challenge. And  I  think ’ going  exacerbate something Jane  I have talked about    next wave  energy politics, I think,  going   centered around affordability   rising stress  meeting energy bills. Our estimates  from  repeat project, that energy bills will    about $280  household  year  2035, again with    variation across households. That’ like  13 percent increase   much    energy, both utility bills  gasoline  heating. How   think, Jane, about  politics  affordability here   Democratic  climate concerned side. Because there’ always been  tension. On   hand,  want  care about affordability. You want energy   affordable  people  need . And   other,    trying  phase   bunch  fossil fuel infrastructure, that’  just  relentless race   cheapest energy possible. You  making energy   margin more expensive  trying  phase  this   move    renewables. Yeah I mean,  politics  those things    brutal,   should  very honest with ourselves about this. I mean,    lessons going into  IRA,  I think coming     that there   mythology that there   silent block  climate voters that represent  majority   American public   willing  sacrifice   name  climate. And while I  wish that   true,   obviously  true. We have   experiment many times . I think, Ezra,   look   solar, wind  batteries,  view  that  most important thing    going forward,   take affordability seriously   take climate seriously,  remove    -market barriers  deploying this stuff  rapidly  possible everywhere. And that’ going   tough   environmental. What  those -market barriers. There  very significant challenges around  planning  transmission planning  siting. We just ’ really   well. We ’ really   anywhere. There  huge issues with permitting that  will   unfamiliar with, both   federal level  frankly,   state  local. Yeah,    state  local. I mean,  have renewable energy projects, fighting  County commissions everywhere across  US  often losing. And  have localities  counties just banning  building  clean energy projects. So here   frustration I  with  Biden administration. I would talk  people  . You were  . We didn’ have this conversation that much,  I   with your colleagues  they knew  these problems. The only permitting reform they ever backed  this half hearted backing  Joe Manchin’ sidecar deals. That   their ideal permitting reform,  ,  course, somewhat poisoned   eyes  progressives because   what Joe Manchin wanted   would clear    this pipeline. And  . But they never  frankly, Democrats  Congress really didn’ propose. This  what  think  ideal permitting system  accelerate clean energy deployment would look like. What would  look like. Like what. What   were writing that bill Jane, what would  write  . Well, I think  thing    that, again, Texas  quite  good example  where this  gone,  gone reasonably, reasonably well. So just looking  Texas,  ’  take  couple  lessons here. One thing  that Texas, unlike many other markets   United States,  done very proactive transmission planning. So they  these what  ,  Krebs clean, renewable energy renewable energy zones. And they  ,   , under George W Bush  Perry. So like  that’ that  should  doing that  across  country, which  basically saying like  know where  renewable potential . We ’ need  wait   developer  come  , , I’ like  connect   grid, just build   highway  there   people connect  ramps. And that’ what they . And  worked very well. So basically they created  transmission infrastructure before they built  energy. Exactly Yeah. There’ also, I think, easier interconnection processes, which  getting more attention. Now there  more than 1000gw  clean energy projects. I mean, maybe they’   real,  they’ waiting   connected  cannot  connected. And I think  haven’ even really done  work  fully diagnose  problem. But  part    just automating  application process. O.K, ’ slow this down. Every energy wonk talks about this endlessly. I ’ think  makes  sense when  normal person hears . When   talking about  problems  these interconnection queues, what   talking about. We’ saying basically,   want  connect   power grid, because  physics   power grid  complicated  ’  connected,   ’ want  grid  ever fail, they have  basically   study  make sure that under  conditions that ’ connected   grid, ’  going  cause  problem, ’  going  cause something  blow   some cascading failure. And right , those studies  meticulously done  individual, highly skilled power engineers  were  short supply. And they  take years more than  average times more than three years, which  just insane. Could ChatGPT  ChatGPT. Could . But  chat agent could    simulations,  then  smart single power engineer could assess them      , right. Like,   make these limited skilled positions superpowered with AI. And  fact, that’ exactly what’ happening  because this  become such  issue just recently. I  think there’    politics   this hasn’ been solved, because basically  incumbents   industry like having high barriers  entry  New competitors. But  demand  started  grow rapidly  capacity, prices, prices,  bring   electricity spiked     biggest power markets   country,  that’ driving  20 percent rate hikes  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland. It’ become very politically salient. You’  Governor Shapiro  Pennsylvania suing  grid operator   like, ,   better . And ’  large data centers being like, , ’ like  connect  three months,   three years. All   sudden,  that they’  this pressure,  grid operator  like, Oh, actually,  could  this  three months,   could  doing this much faster. We should . And I ’, frankly think  should. We should stand  anything longer than   months  complete that process. So that’  thing. Also, just like straight  permitting issues, they just have much laxer kind  friendly  industry regulations  permitting  energy projects  Texas. And that helps that certainly helps. They also have  this  like well beyond  bounds   expertise. But  structure  their particular electricity market tends   much friendlier  New entrants. And building   generation, highly competitive  easy   into  market basically. So like    I think what’ frustrating  , candidly  like  have ample evidence  these  many  these  mature technologies that  both    climate movement. These   cheapest, cheapest  easiest things  build. And then when  comes  getting serious about  ’  happening,  ’  happening   rate  needs  happen,  does raise some difficult questions    coalition around balancing conservation objectives  community engagement processes with  decarbonization goals. And  that reason, I think there’ just been    hesitancy around leaning   this stuff. And  ’ being honest,  deal that happens federally  this stuff  probably going  have  apply  just preferentially  clean energy technologies. It will probably  like  truly    above permitting regime. But  thing ,   look  currently  energy projects   US that have completed environmental impact statements under Nepa,  instance, over  last decade. Clean energy dominates fossil projects like  would almost undoubtedly advantage clean energy over fossil. Yeah, just   power sector, 95 percent    capacity ’ adding   grid right   over  next couple  years  wind, solar,  batteries. 95 percent just making  easier  build period will structurally advantage building clean energy, because that’ most  what  want  build. The climate change   emergency   have  solve   seven years. And  think  primary    that   block  fossil infrastructure. Why would  take that deal. Yeah, this   I think  misunderstanding   climate problem   science   problem  been really problematic  this kind  agenda. So I want  slow down what  just said there, that ’ saying that  climate movement trained itself   idea that  thing  have    keep  dirty energy   ground  stop   fossil infrastructure from being built, because that would    deeper hole  lock  these assets. And  proposals that would create that would make  much, much easier  build energy   kinds, even though  would disproportionately lead  clean energy being built, runs afoul  that intuition that there . I always  this   fight over  mansion,  various mansion bills. There  much more activation around this   natural  pipeline than there  excitement over  much bigger  total emissions impact, changes  transmission line permitting  siting   authorities. Yeah,  I want  hold here   Biden administration   minute. What  just said  minute   probably right that  almost certainly  I said     deal would have   have been     above deal because  would have needed Republican votes just given  structure  Congress. But that’ often true      process. There could have been  proposal  this  what  would like   look like. This  what  think progressive  liberal  Democratic permitting reform would look like. And Yes,   need   into  negotiations. And there’ going   horse trading  concessions. How come I never  that. I think there were very smart people working very much behind  scenes,  I think there   real fear. I think, frankly, probably  misguided fear, although I understand  people  , that sticking your neck   this publicly   ,   self-proclaimed climate champion,  would  tormented basically    this. And  might lose funding. And  ’  environmental organization,  might  viewed   enemy  environmental justice. And that’ brutal. Like that’  deeply unfun position   . And  haven’ . I think ’  reflection   fact that  have   successfully built  environmental   climate movement that creates  permission, structure  incentive  really lean   this stuff. I mean, ’ written about this, Ezra. I mean,  environmental movement that  that provided most   horsepower  date  climate politics  climate policy  built  stop  stuff,   build good stuff. And there’ been  recognition  that  years. I mean, Bill McKibben,     proponent   maximalist approach  many ways  climate politics, also recognizes that  only   solve  problem   build lots  stuff. And ’ trying  figure    activate people around coming  County commissions  fighting  wind farms  solar farms . But this    shift  that kind  political coalition. And ’ going  require, cleaning  slate  starting from scratch  many ways  build institutions  processes that    purpose. And that’ going  remove some    tools that environmental groups have been   still using  stop   stuff. And that’ just  really difficult coalitional politics  navigate. So I think ’ right  finger. This   area where  Biden administration fell short  proposing something. Even  date, congressional Democrats have  proposed  comprehensive,  abundance, energy permitting reform proposal that could  used  anchor  further discussion with Republicans going forward,  I think they should. Let  grab  other pieces  that. So  which  come    times here   planning capacity. I think oftentimes people hear these arguments   energy, abundance permitting,   they hear   deregulatory dimension  . It  always     reporting  this. There need   more bodies  capacity. There’  question  various kinds  environmental reviews, which both have which both raise  question ,   need such intensive environmental reviews  things that    clean energy,  also raises  question ,   have  people needed  create  then respond    environmental reviews ping ponging back  forth from  states   government   . How about that dimension  . What would  look like   state capacity   planning functions  implementation functions that allow these things   built. I mean,   fair,  IRA  include actually $1 billion  enhanced funding     agencies involved  Nepa review. Did that survive. Well,   spent under  Obama years,  ideally, that would  like  ongoing appropriation. But that’ just  piece  this broader mess. I mean,  view  this  that  should  thinking about creating   stop shop process   federal approvals required  these pieces   national infrastructure. And that process should have  finite length,   should  necessarily   thumbs  decision every time. But  long  ’  clear short decision    appropriately staffed   that , well, then industry     make  best case   project    answer pretty quickly. And   answer  , they  pivot   next project. And  ’  that  need  make  really basically disregard  environmental impact. It’ that  need  make these processes streamlined, centralized  fast      thumbs   thumbs down decision that ’  dragged   court  50 years  30. What Like  Department  Commerce creates  strategic Infrastructure Agency. Sure I mean,  didn’ electrify  country  begin with  just tweaking existing regulatory institutions. We created  whole  agencies, created publicly owned utilities. We created rural electrification loan programs,  have   that creative   want   building  scale     infrastructure across  country  Department  Defense today announced  quite muscular industrial policy intervention  basically take equity, meaningful equity stakes   domestic critical minerals company  produce rare earths  electric motors  defense applications. Like there’  version  this agenda  permitting,  planning  industrial policy that  actually  deregulatory. That  really about  much more muscular  centralized state. I think I mean, look, I worked   White House. I think I used     view like Oh, hire more people  more state capacity    better        have  political permission structure,  could just have    people block  like  doesn’. It actually doesn’ matter. So that actually   core   problem. I mean, look yeah, look what they    chips. Act like trying  build these semiconductor fabs  they recognize that they weren’ going   their permits done  time  actually  built. They were just like, ’ just going  reorient this stuff      very fast  wave  whole bunch  things. Yeah, they    things done. They exempted  from  National Environmental Policy Act. Exactly  like   think ’ important   national priority  build more energy infrastructure,  have cheap, affordable, clean electricity,  power economic growth,  power  industries   future, ’  going   there with  status . So ’ 2025. There’ going    midterm election next year. It  very likely,   least very plausible, that Democrats   House. It  less likely,   totally implausible, that they   Senate, though that would  quite hard. Yeah, rough math,    world where Democrats have  lever  power. And  that they  ,   administration wants appropriations speaker Hakeem Jeffries   sign    before  even talk about next time Democrats wield unified power. What should   their agenda  2027? O.K, I have I’ spending    time thinking about this right . And I think   general matter, kind  even leaving  electoral stuff aside,   just took  step back  said, what   most important things     next  years. Because there’ ways  make progress    them. In most political contexts, ’ just  going   exactly what  want thing   remove -market barriers  wide scale deployment   commercial clean EnergyTech. I think  permitting bill needs    huge priority   climate movement maybe thing . And that’ possible because  could actually   fair amount  that’  thing ’ always thought could   bipartisan. There would  things liberals ’ like  . But   imagine  divided government doing totally major permitting only actually,    like I. But I think  intra coalitional politics within  Democratic Party  this  potentially going   tough   climate movement needs  figure  where they want  land  this, because   actually care about deploying clean energy rapidly   scale,  have   this. There just   question. So that’ thing  thing ,   view,   deployment  innovation agenda. So roughly half probably less  global emissions reductions that ’ going    going  come from  renewables  electric vehicles,   other stuff that’    commercial scale. The Uc  remarkably good  inventing  technologies  demonstrating them. And ’ trying   better  deploying them . So  those categories. So that’ things like technologies   power sector that generate electricity, that   solar  wind advanced nuclear power  geothermal  carbon capture  whatever. I think there’  innovation agenda  that could garner bipartisan support. The third pillar, I think,      serious about diffusing   these technologies from OECD  -oecd economies. And even there, I mean, look what’ happening with development funding. A   that  energy  economic development, clean energy  economic development. So what’ happening  development funding   matter  US politics  deeply disturbing  many reasons. And this    them. But I  think there   some opportunity  trade  better. Well, ’   better integrate climate into  trade policy. And I think  US  going   more muscular   kind  approach  economic statecraft   relates  energy  supply chains, whether that’ countering  rise  China  other countries  whatever. But ’  that third pillar   what people typically think  when they think  international climate action where they think   like, rejoin  Paris Accord  more multilateralism   UNFCCC  climate targets. What I’ proposing  something that I think could happen, even   world where ’   entirely  Democrats. I mean, I think  long term  credit,  investment  credit   order  10 percent    carbon free electricity. Beyond  ones that  less mature    higher level currently would make sense from  public policy perspective. I mean, there   public good value  having more  cheaper energy. There’  public good value  that energy being cleaner. And  ’  going  subsidize   ’  going  penalize  dirty stuff, ’  going   provided   scale that  want. But that’  much smaller  much less expensive subsidy than   that  implemented under  IRA. I ’ think ’ going   back  that regime, where ’ basically covering half   cost   wind  solar farm    next decade. One   areas that I’ most concerned about beyond climate   impacts  this bill,  that   basically upended  electric vehicle  battery competitiveness strategy that  implemented over  last several years,   pretty thoughtful     counter  rise  China, which  just utterly dominating global markets right   electric vehicles. We were just   point where  were starting   major investment   US battery supply chain  electric vehicle deployment. We were seeing  models,  more competitive market,   automakers investing   real strategy   competitive  that space. And   look globally   future   auto industry, ’  electric  autonomous. And   want   autonomous vehicles,  also need them   electric. For  most part, they have  have  large enough batteries  onboard power infrastructure     computers  sensors that  need    autonomous vehicle,  China     that stuff. Its entire market  devoted  that . And  US,   doesn’ find    compete  that space, will find itself with  automotive industry that  basically shut  from  other global markets,  that  only supplying  shrinking share  even   domestic market, where internal combustion engine vehicle sales peaked long    only declining. And  just blew that  . Our whole industrial strategy there  just basically destroyed  this bill. Something   replace that. And I  think there  bipartisan interest  having  competitive auto industry   having  ability  produce batteries. I mean, just look this executive order around rare earths. Like just from  defense. Only interest like  future  warfighting will involve batteries everywhere  well. The times  this piece recently comparing energy  energy related exports  China   US. And   really striking. I mean,  look  US exports $117 billion  crude , China 844 million. We export $42 billion  natural . China 3 billion. So ’ like  look   energy   past  ’  ahead. But then China exports $40 billion  solar panels  modules. We export $69 million worth  . They export $65 billion worth  lithium  batteries. We export $3 billion. Their EV exports   ahead  ours right . I mean, China’ been absolutely going       these industries. Part   IRA  trying   some part  them back. And even   ’ care   about  clean energy implications, ’ pretty clear these  growing industries. Yeah, I mean, I look  China  I look   emergence  what  like  first global electro state versus Petro states, ’ basically doubling down    Petro state with  Republican strategy. We should  clear,  behind right. It’  that ’ like losing  edge. We  already  behind  these industries. And  IRA   infrastructure  were pretty concerted efforts     back   point where  could compete. And  those  gone, something else    there. Or ’ basically just giving . We’ unilaterally disarming  saying what, China. Go  . The entire world auto market  yours. You  signaled that maybe   list  innovative technologies   still funding, there  something that could become   deal when  look  those more nascent technologies, green hydrogen, I mean, people  very excited about advanced geothermal  couple  years . I ’ quite tell  that  sustained   same level. I love . Hot rocks. Hot rocks. Yeah what looks most promising there. If  were. If  were really placing bets. What should  really  throwing ourselves behind. I mean, I  think that advanced geothermal   most promising thing right ,  ’  surprising that  United States   Petro state, that drilling  extremely good  drilling wells   drilled millions  them. What makes advanced geothermal advanced. So there’  different flavors  ,    that’ advancing most rapidly  basically using directional drilling  hydraulic fracturing techniques that were developed originally  extract shale   . The spillover effect  public innovation, ’ also publicly driven innovation, were   being applied   very different geology  create very different reservoirs. So totally different engineering design,   same kind  core techniques  basically create  bunch  fractures   ground that   circulate water through  extract  heat from  Earth. The other strategy   closed loop geothermal technology. And I should disclose I’   advisory board   company that does this called ever technologies. And they basically just drill lots    back loops. And both  those technologies allow   basically build geothermal anywhere   drill into  rock,  opposed  needing  kind  natural  springs type formation  fissures that naturally circulate water. Whereas this could these technologies could allow geothermal   built  terawatt scale globally. So  could  building hundreds  gigawatts nuclear fleets worth  advanced geothermal   long term. And  US     best competitive position  that area because   strength      industry. So this could   where   have  competitive edge,  ’  nice     longer list than that. I mean, advanced nuclear, I ’  . I mean, this     ones where, Yes, maybe talk that  because I think people  interested  know  advanced nuclear something I should believe . Give   case  advanced. No  ,  whether  US  compete. Yeah I mean, I   absolutely. I think Jesse  I  totally agree that advanced nuclear  worth investing  both Fusion  fission. What makes  advanced. Much smaller. Really much smaller. More compartmentalized  contained. Slightly different designs. Mechanisms  self cool. So that ’  dealing with  large scale cooling infrastructure that  need  generation three plants. Some  them  different coolant loops  things like that, both inherently safe. And I think more importantly, since  nuclear fleet  already incredibly safe,  hopefully cheaper  build. And that’   , which    smaller    economies  scale  manufacturing. But  your skepticism   that  technology  real. Your skepticism  that  would  good  . Exactly   like  first designs will  approved   next couple  years. The first  just ,  there will    more coming. It just takes years  build these things. So  first demonstration reactors,  first   kind, will come online  2029  30  31  32. Meanwhile, China  already building them. They have small modular reactors that they’ building. They have  cooled high temperature reactors that they’ already building  Koreans   there selling large scale reactors  building them   UAE  time   budget. The Chinese  offering that   competitors around  world, . And  while    area where  have    engineering know      technical capability   United States   good investment environment  support innovative firms,   starting ’ starting  decade behind. That’  problem. We’ starting, well, 5, 10 years behind  competitors  South Korea  China. And  I hope   compete there. But ’   means  slam dunk. So  things that I think  more relevant      risk ladder  climate change. One  that various forms  carbon capture  removal  direct  capture, which I know ’ been involved , become more salient. So most   technologies ’ talking about  ways  generating energy without creating  emissions. But    begin  suck emissions    atmosphere   something with them, maybe   begin  reverse  damage ’ already done  about  . I know ’ been engaged  efforts  create  market  that. Why ’  start with that . What   think  direct  capture. How plausible  . At what scale. Like   situation where ’  really  shape, where  risk  turning    worse than   hoped. How much does that. How much could  actually pump into that  pump  through that. Yeah, I mean, I think there     open questions here   need  work  figure    quickly  possible. My view  this  always been  need  know   . The models  assuming that  exists  large scale  solve   climate problem. So  have  obligation    instrumental work  figure   that’ possible  begin with. And ’ starting   that, which I think  very good. The challenge with removing CO2 from  ambient   putting  somewhere permanently,  that ’ hard   like thermodynamically    difficult  . And  bigger problem  what I’ been spending,  spent time working , which   market development problem, which   will   cleaning  this invisible trash that   seems  actually care about. That  like that   . I think that   bigger challenge than  technology   economics. It’ largely just like  pays. I mean,    pure. And  what  going ,  thing  worked , just  clear about   stripe, which   digital payments processing company, basically created  side project  create some market  people    demonstrate they could  this  stripe would  them. When  talk about things that government should  doing, that really felt   like  where  government should  putting money behind  very risky technology  order    create  market,  order    create  innovative loop that would make this viable. And      I mean,  . So  Bipartisan infrastructure   several billion dollars  demonstrate direct  capture facilities. There    credit that   enhanced   Inflation Reduction Act, which remains  The New bill, extended that would give  $180    CO2 that  pull from  ambient   store permanently. So there  some policy infrastructures that  nowhere near  scale  investment that  need  make these things real. So that’ first  . I mean, I think there     things ’ discovering  that there  carbon permanent carbon removal pathways. So there’ direct  capture,  there  other pathways that   really been   mind  folks   years , things like enhanced rock weathering, where ’ grinding   bunch  basalt rocks  putting them , increasing their surface area  exposing them  moisture  that they more rapidly  what they would  anyway, which  draw CO2 down  store  permanently. Jane loves rocks, I love rocks, I love rocks,  . But  point with some  these technologies  that there  -climate -benefits. There  agricultural,   have productivity  yield increases   consequence  doing this  fields where ’ better managing  pH  soil   land  more productive. So I tend   more optimistic because I really believe that  ,  need   very candid with ourselves, which  painful  those     concerned about  climate crisis. That society’ willingness    pure climate action  very . It  certainly  high enough   large scale carbon removal   cost today,  scale. So  view, I think that’ somewhat shared here,  that  role  technology  politics  economics here, this goes   feedback versus feedback analogy  metaphor. Is that  role       cost  these technologies down  much  possible, such that  marginal unit  political will,   sake  pure climate benefit required   this stuff,     humanly possible. So  role  these technologies   impact  should   keep them alive  give birth  them  many cases   them   level where  understand  risks,  understand  benefits,  ideally, ’ reduced  cost  some degree. So that      point where  decide, O.K,  really need these. Then there  real option    option   model   made , option   piece  paper. Well then  does that affect    technologies  call geoengineering? And   sorts  very good reasons, people, I think, worry about trying  manipulate  climate with  slightly better than monkey brains. But  ’ screwed  ,  might   unscrew    things  particularly . Totally    think about  funding  exploration  geoengineering   kind   hedge. Yeah  view  this  I   dissertation  solar geoengineering, which     ideas. We’ talking about here. I think,  ,  right   think about  potential value  solar geoengineering  managing climate risk  that  ’ have that many tools  manage climate,  manage increased temperatures that  fast acting,  solar geoengineering masking some   incoming warming    that  could    very  tools that could work really fast   were   dire situation. So  ,   pure level  scientific,  this worthy  scientific inquiry. For ,  answer  Yes. Now, technologies aren’ just inherently good  . They need   governed  steered  ways. And  concern about solar geoengineering research  deployment  that  have such  trust  institutions right  that  ability   science  these riskier  these domains,    that’ like truly aligned with global societal benefit  just difficult  imagine. On  other hand, ’ spending    money  time     other technologies that I’ quite concerned about  global impact  them  that  ’ subject them   same level  scrutiny. So   fair   colleagues, I will  yeah, ’ create  godlike artificial intelligence that  explicitly intend    replace human beings   work that gives them both wages  dignity. But yeah,  have  plans  have  plan. And just like whatever. Like people seem like they  make    money  . Go forth. But this. How dare  even think about . Having worked  geoengineering   long time,   very frustrating, because I’ been  countless social, scientific, academic meetings where   opine  opine, should   shouldn’ . Should  even   research. Who should   research. And   same time that  were doing that, this  happening    cares. It’ like  actually . And then once  happens, ’ almost unwatchable. We’ just going  build   data centers  hope   best. Totally because  I think because I  that there  potential promise  solar geoengineering  reducing suffering. I’ very worried about research  this topic  agenda setting  this topic   cultural politics  this topic being overtaken   Silicon Valley essentially I ’ think that  good   long term politics  substance  solar geoengineering. And  I  concerned about cultivating even less trust  this   potential technologies based   seems   excited about them   ’. Let    this. So imagine some world Democrats take back power  2028. They    Senate. They    presidency. They’ going   facing after this bill,  very different fiscal position than  Biden administration  facing. So  idea that  will  easy  spend hundreds  billions  dollars      true. By then,  will  hard  raise. It’ always hard  raise taxes,    code  going   pretty broken after this. I mean, just ’  shot full  holes that I’  least come   view that full   reform might  something  need  consider     haven’   very long time. And when taxes  work     different ways. But      them    raise money  taxing things  ’ like carbon taxes, which used    thing  talked about   time   climate space have fallen   favor. They’ considered  politically hard. They’  been  that politically stable. On  other hand, nothing else  working  exactly perfectly either. In  world where     very, very difficult fiscal position. But  carbon   something that  should  putting back   table. Is that  idea that  2029, ’ time will have finally come. Yeah    that what I think  need   doing  that point  figuring    that   continue  drive accelerated deployment  mature technologies  solutions  decarbonize  economy. Maybe ’  much smaller  credit. Maybe ’  regulatory policy that doesn’ have  direct fiscal impact,   impact  household expenditures  small enough that  doesn’ have political blowback  ’ indirect enough. I mean, ’ look,  Highway Trust Fund  been bankrupt,   have  been able  raise    even   rate  inflation. And   idea that ’ going  have  substantive carbon price even because ’ fiscally necessary, I just ’ think  very plausible. But  $10   , which would make  difference   power sector  making coal less competitive  making renewables more  would only raise  price  gasoline  less than 10 centimeters  gallon   world where EVs   competitive option. Maybe that’ politically possible,  I think  need   very clear. It’  going   $100   carbon price that  going  transform  energy economy. It’ going    thing. It    several options that   , I think,  that last mile pull  mature technologies into  market   pace that reflects their public good nature  being clean  helping decarbonize. The other thing I will  about carbon pricing  that  does  into your broader point about  politics  regulation   constraints  increasing energy prices   politics  affordability. Yeah, exactly. Tax their energy. So   want  advise  Democratic Party  take that position   name  climate. I mean, that’  hard sell. It would have     context    reform that  other things people really liked. This   thing I want  think about   coming months  years. But what would  look like   actually tried  rethink   code   pretty fundamental , such that I ’ think   step forward  your pitch , , I have  carbon . Your life  what   , plus  carbon . That’  going  work. No,    said this  code  completely broken. It  taxing  wrong things. We  taxing  much work from  wrong people. We  letting  many things  want less  proliferate. We have made   easy    hedge fund manager, right. You  imagine something that  part   much bigger pitch. And  part  that pitch, there’  modest   pollution. Yeah which  what ’ talking about here. And , , I would   that  centerpiece   Democratic administration that cares about this should   carbon . But I would  that I think   going     world   next Democratic administration where  fiscal position  much worse    code  completely broken. And I think  would   mistake   entire debate     reverse some  Donald Trump’  cuts. Yeah, I agree. I think  have  begin  rethink this  then  yourself, what     principles   core  that rethinking that make both actual substantive sense, policy sense  make political sense. It doesn’ mean every component  that will  hugely popular. Nobody likes paying taxes  anything,  would they prefer there’  little  more   pollution  opposed  more taxes  them working. There  things  could think. The problem I have with this  that ’  hard  proactively predict   this will play  politically,   will   much polling that supports what ’ saying,   have seen  ever  climate, everyone’ like, ,  polls show everyone likes support. And then    experiment where there’ state ballot initiatives  whatever, even  modest carbon prices,  they fail. But I ’ disagree with ,  I’ happy   whatever experiments that  want  . I just  that   evidence from  world’ experiments with carbon pricing,  that  generally works best when    carbon pricing   sake  carbon pricing,  carbon pricing that  raising revenue, that’ providing public goods that people want. We     schools,      roads,       this stuff. And     going  raise that money. Well,    ways ’ going     through congestion pricing  New York City. Now ’ working quite well. So I  think   context   need revenue raisers  make  fairer, more progressive  code,  shouldn’    table. But I  think  have   very clear about  politics  affordability will also  quite high  that point. I think that   good place  . So  final question, what  three books ’ recommend   audience. And Jane,   started with , ’ start Jesse with . He’ going   “Abundance.” Classic. No,  I have just finished reading “Abundance.” The next    list  Marc Dunkelman’ “Why Nothing Works,” which I think  probably  great place  folks  have read your book  pick  next. I’ excited  pick  . I haven’ read  ,  ’   nightstand. The next . I would ,  “Energy: A Human History”  Richard Rhodes. A historian that I think rightfully puts energy   center   human story. How  make   energy  central    structure society. And I guess maybe  that note, I read    science fiction  fantasy  take  break from  this heavy stuff. And   that I’ call   Kim Stanley Robinson’ Mars trilogy. I think ’  great example   story   humanity might muddle through  next couple hundred years that I think grapples with  changing technology -evolves with society  really interesting ways. And I’ always found  that futurism helps open  mind  maybe this could    different  than  think. We ’ know what  future’ going  look like. We ’ know what options  going  emerge  give    tool   toolkit. We definitely ’ know  that’ going  have ramifications  society, whether that’ AI  something else. And  Robinson’ work, I think   really great   just engage  speculative history   future. Well, I’  less nerdy than Jesse. So  first recommendation  first recommendation  Norman Rush’ “Mating,” which  just — I just read that. Did  love ? I loved  first -thirds  . In  view, that novel  sublime  beautiful  funny   exploration  love  anthropology  science  justice. And I love that book. The social scientist recommended  social science love story. That’ exactly right. That’ exactly right. The second   “Frontiers  Illusion”  Daniel Sarewitz,   just  brilliant thinker around science  technology policy —  science  society. And  just does  really great  laying  both  myths,  myths that  believe about science    operates    need  . We need  seriously, take  look  those myths  order  enhance  relationship  science  social outcomes that  want  achieve. And then  last   Donald MacKenzie’ “An Engine, Not  Camera,” which  also kind   social studies  science book,  ’  really brilliant analysis   role  economic models  theory  finance,   descriptive representations  empirical reality,   actual drivers   those markets operate themselves  book  models. These modelers need  understand their power,  ’ just  great book. And I think about    time   context   role  models  climate  environmental policy. Jane Flegal, Jesse Jenkins, thank  very much. Thank . Thanks, Ezra.
