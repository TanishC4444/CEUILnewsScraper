UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy  condemned Israel' conduct  Gaza  said that Britain could " more   coming weeks"   Israeli government does  change    pursuing     strip. He expressed anger that  "international community   been able  bring this    "  said   "sickened"   killings  Palestinians   centres  Israeli forces  recent days. Since Israel began  military campaign  Gaza after  7 October attacks, significant public attention  focused   issue  assistance provided   UK. Much   weaponry used  Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) strikes   strip  been built  sold  Western nations. But information around  extent   UK' military support  Israel often remains unclear  classified,  some MPs have called   public inquiry into  extent   assistance.

Does  UK supply Israel with arms?

The UK     Israel' main suppliers  arms. The US     biggest seller - helping Israel develop    world' most advanced militaries - followed  Germany  Italy. Since 2015,  UK  approved arms export licences  Israel worth over £500m ($676.4m) - peaking  2018, according  Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) pressure group. However, much   attention around  UK' support  Israel  focussed  parts made  Britain   F-35 . A state--- multi-role fighter,   been used extensively  Israel  strike Gaza. The UK supplies between 13-15%   components used   , including ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers  weapon release cables. After  Labour Party came  power last year,  suspended 30   350 arms export licences, affecting equipment such  parts  fighter jets, helicopters  drones. Any UK company that wants  sell arms abroad must apply   licence,   government said   time that there   "clear risk"  equipment could  used  commit serious violations  international . But crucially, parts   F-35 were  included   export . The government said  could  prevent Israel obtaining these components  they  sent  manufacturing centres abroad  part   global programme -  directly  Israel.

Professor Anna Stavrianakis,  expert  UK Arms Export, described  government' decision  allow  this exemption  " enormous loophole". "UK-made parts   F-35 mostly    USA, where they  incorporated into jets bound  Israel,"  told BBC Verify, noting that because  White House "does  want  stop supporting Israel",  UK export bans were quite limited  their effectiveness. The UK also -developed  Hermes drone, which  been widely used  Gaza. While  UK version   aircraft, called  Watchkeeper 450,  unarmed,  Israeli-made Hermes drone   armed with Spike missiles   reportedly used   attack that killed seven World Central Kitchen  workers last year. It  hard   what  UK  still exporting  Israel under  active licences. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said last year that      "blanket    arms embargo"  said  remained essential that Israel could defend itself from attack. According   Department  Business  Trade, 161   extant licences relate  military products. A UK Parliament report said that  remaining licences could include "items such  trainer aircraft  naval equipment,  dual- items  civilian   telecoms  data equipment".

Has  UK shared intelligence with Israel?

The extent  which  UK  shared intelligence with Israel since  7 October attacks  unclear. The government   long-standing "defence partnership with Israel" which defence officials  includes "education, joint training  capability development". The Royal Air Force (RAF)  flown hundreds  surveillance flights over Gaza since December 2023, reportedly using Shadow R1  planes based   RAF base  Akrotiri  nearby Cyprus. In  interview  Monday, Lammy insisted that  RAF flights over Gaza have     sharing   military intelligence with  IDF. "It would  quite wrong   British government  assist   prosecution  this   Gaza,"  foreign secretary said. "We   doing that."

In 2023  UK acknowledged that some   "unarmed" drones circling over  strip were aiding   search  Israeli hostages taken  Hamas during  7 October attacks. There  50 people still held  Hamas, with 20 believed   alive. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard reaffirmed that stance  April 2025, telling MPs that UK drone flights over Gaza were being conducted with  "sole purpose  locating hostages". The Ministry  Defence (MoD)  refused  comment  whether Israeli aircraft have access   RAF' base  Cyprus. But BBC Verify also identified Israeli Air Force planes  UK airspace over  past year after reports   independent outlet DropSite. Several Re' refuelling planes appeared  specialised flight tracking sites over RAF bases  Brize Norton  Fairford. An MoD spokesperson told BBC Verify: "It  standard practice  routinely authorise requests  limited numbers  allies  partners  access  UK'  bases." "We cannot comment   provide information relating  foreign nations' military aircraft movements  operations,"  spokesperson added.

Are Israeli troops training   UK?

The UK often runs training courses   militaries  allied nations, many  which focus  leadership, logistics  cyber-operations. For example, thousands  Ukrainian troops have come  Britain since Russia launched  full-scale invasion  2022  basic training.

National Urban League says Trump' policies amount  emergency  Black Americans

One   nation' oldest Civil Rights organization warns  Trump administration' policies have thrust  country into  "state  emergency"  antidiscrimination policies, personal freedoms  black economic advancement.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

For 49 years,  National Urban League  released  report  calls  State  Black America. This year,  title  State  Emergency: Democracy, Civil Rights And Progress Under Attack. What does  mean that    country' oldest civil rights groups   declaring  emergency  Black Americans? Marc Morial  president  CEO   National Urban League. Welcome back   program.

MARC MORIAL: Great   with .

SUMMERS: I want  start  with that question. Briefly describe    state  emergency  Black America that    spell   this report.

MORIAL: There'  unprecedented attack   gains   last 70 years. And think about . Seventy years , Brown .  Board  Education began  dismantling  segregation  America. Ten years later,  passage   Civil Rights Act. For  first time, there were legal protections against discrimination  fact,  just discrimination  . That effort  being attacked viciously . And what -    being attacked? - voter suppression,  attack  equal opportunity under  guise that somehow equal opportunity  discriminatory    itself - that'   attacks  DE  I  -   cutbacks  government initiatives  programs - whether ' Medicaid, food stamps, education, veterans' benefits - that help make America stronger  better  create opportunity  . Taken together,   last  months, ' seen  most aggressive assault   progress ' made  modern American history.

SUMMERS: There'     into here,  I just want  pull apart some   specifics  mentioned -    policies supporting diversity, equity  inclusion, which I' note  been happening    years . To your mind, what  changed since people  oppose these types  policies came into power   federal government  2025?

MORIAL: Think about  executive orders that seek  shut down  enforcement mechanisms,  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,  Department  Education   complete change  mission   Civil Rights Division. All  these specific things when taken together just simply represent  assault   idea  equal opportunity,   idea  racial justice,   idea , , diversity, equity  inclusion, which   strength  America -  powerful, powerful strength  America. And that    many   have   stand   very strong effort  resist through  courts. Some  protesting. We' doing everything possible    slow down this movement,     movement. It' called  MAGA movement. You  call  that. But ' bigger than politics because    broad-based assault, using public policy   weapon against equal opportunity.

SUMMERS: I - well,  mentioned  Department  Justice' Civil Rights Division here,  I just want  present  with something that  department posted   social media site X, formerly known  Twitter. They point  that  Civil Rights Division " returned  enforcing    written fairly, equally  without political agenda,"  quote. How   read that?

MORIAL: It'  bogus argument. It'  cover story. It'  smokescreen behind  effort  weaponize  Civil Rights Division. Why would  suspend   civil rights cases that were pending when  took office? Why would    court  Louisville  suggest that  officer   been convicted   crime   - sentence  shooting into someone' home, after  jury that heard  evidence said  violated  civil rights, ...

SUMMERS: You' talking there about  case related...

MORIAL: ...Sentencing guidelines...

SUMMERS: ...To  killing  Breonna Taylor.

MORIAL: Of Breonna Taylor,  -  sentencing guidelines recommend  sentence  multiple years. The department' rhetoric rings hollow with many   because what  understand  that    diversion. It  trying  divert people away from  real facts,  that they' saying '  going  prosecute police officers  violate people' civil rights. We'  going  attack corruption  police departments -  systemic,   will, corruption  brutality. Instead, ' going    Civil Rights Division  wage    political enemies.

SUMMERS: Harrison Fields, '  White House spokesman,  said that civil rights groups that oppose  Trump administration aren' -  I' quoting Harrison Fields here - "aren' advancing anything  hate  division, while  president  focused  uniting  country." Marc Morial, this administration  repeatedly touted  tried  showcase efforts  promote what  calls meritocracy ,  argues , equality  opportunity. What   make  that?

MORIAL: The  , merit  ? And what civil rights laws  about  merit  everyone. In other words, give everyone with merit  opportunity. Historically,  this country,   . Merit meant white . That' what  meant  fact,  that    country  organized until  civil rights laws  passed.

SUMMERS: What would  like    response  these actions ' been discussing from  Trump administration? What'  playbook?

MORIAL: Well, I think ' going  require  change  policy. It' going  require  change  approach. We'  going   that with  Trump administration, clearly. So I think  roads  going  lead   next   elections  this country, where Americans  going  have  vote  what they believe  policy   approach ought   when  comes  civil rights  equal opportunity.

SUMMERS: This report   State  Black America,  I just want   , what   hope that  Americans   races take away from this report?

MORIAL: I' glad  asked that question because  many respects, while    State  Black America report,   more  state   union report  this climate. The attacks   rule  ,  attacks - ' just take diversity, equity  inclusion. Diversity, equity  inclusion benefits women - women   races -   substantially benefited white women. It benefits Latinos. It' benefited those   disabled. It' benefited large, large numbers  Asians. I mean,  concept  diversity  been about taking those ' been locked , left   marginalized  giving them  real opportunity  advance into  American mainstream. And  this report    Americans. We should understand  founding fathers said that  hold these truths   self-evident that  people  created equal. If those principles mean something, then  more diverse America,  more inclusive America   .

SUMMERS: We' been speaking with Marc Morial,  president  CEO   National Urban League. Thank   much.

MORIAL: Hey, thank   having , always.

Have  girls   boys? Study suggests  odds aren' 50/50

Couples ' been surprised   string  baby boys  baby girls could  forgiven  wondering whether  odds   offspring lottery  more than just pure chance. A  study  Harvard University researchers that examines  birthing records  58,007 women suggests their hunch might  correct.

The authors   study, published   journal Science Advances last week, found that instead  straight 50/50 odds between boys  girls with each birth,  offspring  families with  least three children tend  follow what scientists call  "weighted coin toss," indicating that each family  have  distinct tendency toward girls  boys.

"We' seeing     having only boys  girls," says Siwen Wang,  doctoral student   Harvard T.H. Chan School  Public Health   lead author   study. That    colleagues  wonder "whether ' simply  chance,   there  underlying biology explaining these  clustering within families?"

They analyzed data from  second  third iteration   Nurses' Health Study, which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across  U.S. from 1956  2015.

They found that   first  children born   family  girls,  chances   third child also being  girl  higher than    —  this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true   first   boys: The likelihood  having another  increases,   trend persists through later births.

"Notably,  families with three boys (MMM),  probability  having another   61%;  families with three girls (FFF),  probability  having another girl  58%,"  study authors wrote.

Looking   possible explanation, "   things that stands     first birth — that' associated with  moderately higher chance  having only boys  girls," Wang says. "If ' starting your family younger than 23 ... [there ] around  40% chance  having  same- family,"  says. If  woman begins having children after  28, ' around 50% —  relatively small  statistically significant difference.

The researchers excluded families with only  child  pregnancies ending  miscarriage, stillbirth  twins. Women with  history  infertility treatments were also left    study. To avoid bias from parents  stopped having children after reaching  preferred  ratio,  researchers   count each woman' final birth   analysis.

The researchers speculate that  older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into  results  that changes  vaginal acidity might favor  survival  sperm carrying either  Y (boys)  X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal  paternal ages  often correlated,  father'  might also play  role. Since  study included only women,  authors emphasize that  exact mechanism remains uncertain.

"We ' have data about  ," Wang says. "We ' have data about  genetics  even very precise characteristics ... which  obviously important   determination."

It'  concern also raised  Mark Gerstein,  professor  Yale University  wasn' involved   research. Gerstein specializes  applying computational approaches  molecular biology. "Given  disparity observed  mothers   study,  could easily envision  equally impactful relationship with either  genetics     father,"  says. "This seems like  promising area  future research  explore."

Ralph Catalano,  emeritus professor  public health   University  California, Berkeley,  also wasn' involved   research, thinks that  study' narrow focus    birth   show  full picture. "Fewer than 50%  conceptions reach birth. More than 50%  spontaneously aborted [miscarried],  that'   random draw,"  says.

Due  immunological  developmental sensitivity, females  more likely   spontaneously aborted early  pregnancy, while males  more vulnerable  spontaneous abortion later  pregnancy because they  physically frailer,  says. "The   infants   — those  make   birth —  shaped  much   utero selection     conception,"  says.

Another caveat   composition   sample. The Nurses' Health Study that  sample  drawn from  made   overwhelmingly white women residing   United States. "Since  preferences  reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions,  countries …   ratio distribution pattern observed   study   apply  other societies,"  researchers acknowledge.

The groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication  accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For  democracy  endure  another 250 years,  hopefully much longer,  must share  commitment  facts… Today represents  ringing endorsement  truth   democracy.”

The right-wing network said   statement that  “acknowledge[]  Court’ rulings finding certain claims about Dominion   false,” referring  Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged  presidential election. But Fox ’ have  admit - that  spread lies about Dominion,  Dominion representative told CNN.

The $787.5 million payout  roughly half   $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though   nearly 10 times  company’ valuation from 2018,  roughly eight times  annual revenue  2021, according  court filings.

The witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch,  CEO  Lachlan Murdoch,   Fox hosts like Sean Hannity  Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts,  deposition testimony made public during  case revealed that these figures,  many others  Fox, privately said  2020 that  vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But  lies were spread - anyway.

Rupert Murdoch thought  election denialism  “really crazy,” even  Fox personalities peddled those same claims  millions  viewers. Carlson said  “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency   “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers,  senior executives privately said   - claims   stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless”  “mind-blowingly nuts.”

These revelations generated months  blistering headlines  Fox   case moved toward trial. By settling , Fox deprived Dominion  chance  further expose  dishonesty with  weeks-long trial.

Fox News  Fox Corporation –  parent company, which  also  defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion,    case   meritless assault  First Amendment press freedoms.

Dramatic days  Delaware

But when  proceedings didn’ promptly resume after lunch,  chances   deal seemed  rise   minute, even though   lawyers from both sides    courtroom, looking  their phones,  waiting.

The racially diverse jury      women  brought back into  court, ready  their front- seat   historic trial. But Davis,  judge, instead told  panel they helped spur  settlement.

“Your presence here, short compared  what  thought,  uneventful   certain sense,  extremely important,” Davis said. “Without ,  parties would  have been able  resolve their situation.”

Many   Dominion side cast  settlement   victory  democracy   truth itself.

“Fox  admitted  telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage   company,  employees,   customers that  serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.

While  Dominion case   over, Fox News  still facing  second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that  similarly smeared  Fox News’ shows after  2020 election. That case  still   discovery process,   trial ’ expected anytime soon.

For  part, Dominion still  pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax  OAN,  well  against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell  Mike Lindell. They  deny wrongdoing.

CNN —

Millions  Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy  navigate    debt trap     President Joe Biden that  instead threatening  capture  House Republicans.

The California Republican traveled  Wall Street  Monday  deliver  fresh warning that  House GOP majority will refuse  lift    government borrowing unless Biden agrees  spending cuts that would effectively neutralize  domestic agenda  neuter  White House legacy.

McCarthy also assured traders, however, that  would never   US government default   obligations –  potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger  recession  unleash  cuts   fall   event that  debt ceiling   raised.

This  where  risk  Americans comes . It’ hard     rookie speaker, with  tiny majority   conference containing plenty  extremists,  engineer either  these outcomes.

Most countries ’ require  legislature  raise  government’ borrowing threshold. But  quirky situation   US  made  once routine duty  opportunity  political mischief   polarized . Since  government spends more than  makes  revenue,  must borrow money  service  debt    spending that Congress  already authorized. It   problem getting more credit since  US pays  bills   always   stellar credit rating, despite  previous downgrade from  threat  default.

At least, that’     worked until .

McCarthy beseeched  conference   closed-door meeting  Tuesday  line  behind  bill that would raise  debt limit   year  require  flurry  spending concessions from Biden. He styled  measure   initial   forcing  president   negotiating table. But  bill  purely tactical since ’   chance  passing  Democratic- Senate.

But   sign   difficult  will    speaker  even pull this gambit , there were signs  internal disagreement  what should    package among GOP members.

Rep. Scott Perry,  chairman   hardline House Freedom Caucus,  frustrated about  lack  specificity   plan  wanted steeper cuts.

“I ’ know what’   package completely. That’  issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant  commit  . Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’ Manu Raju, “I’ open    I’ still  ‘’ vote.”

It   unusual  various factions   congressional majority  haggle over details before  final package  agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry,  McCarthy ally,  confident  plan would pass  House. “The question , what does  White House then  once  pass this package? We’ clearly stated there   clean debt ceiling that will pass  House,”  added. “So ’ have  first opening offer here. And ’    president’ willing  come   table  negotiate like previous presidents have.”

McHenry’ comment, however, reflected   flaw   GOP strategy since  relies  McCarthy’ belief that Biden will have  choice   come   table. The White House  insisted  House should     pass  simple bill that only raises  borrowing limit

In effect, McCarthy  already    severe test   leadership since there’  guarantee that   pass  measure   House where   only lose four votes   which there   signs  fractious GOP  agree  what programs      much. And even   measure does squeeze through  House   coming weeks,  will likely   idealized Republican product  which Biden   Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter  GOP support.

Still,  speaker  typically bullish when  predicted Monday ’ have  votes  pass  initial bill.

“I think   218  raise  debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’     consensus within  conference. We’  together  work through .”

His assurances    very reassuring, however, because  similarly blithe predictions that    votes    speakership  January degenerated into  farcical process that   make huge concessions   party’ most radical members  required 15 ballots before  finally      dreams.

But with  debt ceiling,  will  Americans’ livelihoods   global economy, rather than McCarthy’ immediate political ambitions, that    line.

Republicans    agree  their  demands

So , Republicans seem   having trouble negotiating with themselves,  alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson  South Dakota,   helping  fashion  GOP’ position, said that while  party hopes  pass  initial bill next week, challenges remain.

“I think  hardest part  just that there   unlimited number  conservative policy victories that,  course,   want   worked ,” Johnson told CNN’ Manu Raju. “The reality  that   negotiation,  never  everything  want. And  I think  biggest issue right      squeeze these thousands  desires down   manageable  credible number  asks?”

Another complication  that some members   Republican conference have said they will never vote  raise  debt ceiling  principle –  matter what. In  powerful Republican majority such holdouts could  ignored. In McCarthy’ narrow majority – secured after  2022 midterm election that fell short  GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive  help McCarthy    event  GOP defections since they’ presumably have  vote  huge cuts that Biden  opposed   final GOP bill. And  speaker probably couldn’ risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing   rule,   battled    , that lets  single member call  vote   ouster.

The coming showdown over  debt ceiling  potentially  defining moment   -year period  uneasy cohabitation between  Democratic president  Republican speaker. Neither Biden  McCarthy  afford  lose,   outcome will shape both their legacies.

Republicans  have less leverage than they think

There  nothing wrong with Republicans seeking    leverage they    democratic election    further their political goals  cutting public spending. There  some GOP lawmakers  sincerely worry about debt  deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty  economists worry about  always ballooning national debt, which  crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’  spending  Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures  health care programs triggered  debate  whether  worsened  inflation crisis.

But  Republicans choosing  right hill  this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans   economic well-being  millions   risk? The absolutist nature  McCarthy’ position pays little heed   delicate balance  power. Democrats control  White House   Senate,   handing Republicans  House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.

Republicans  also facing claims  hypocrisy, since they  little problem raising  debt limit when Donald Trump,  rarely worried about making   spending splash,  president. The 45th commander  chief  also  videotape dating   White House days saying  couldn’ believe anyone would   debt ceiling   “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats   office  often look  other  when there    their    Oval Office.

McCarthy needs  reverse  blame equation

In order  prevail  this fight, McCarthy   somehow change  political dynamic  saddling Biden with  blame   default   economic tensions that could begin  unfold even before  country plunges over  fiscal cliff.

He tried     Monday  insisting that  biggest threat   US economy wasn’  default  rising national debt.

“Without exaggeration American debt   ticking time bomb that will detonate unless  take serious responsible action. Yet,   President Biden reacted  this issue? He  done nothing. So   view,  I think  rest  America, ’ irresponsible,”  said.

Previous fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses  Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly  Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton  Barack Obama,  example, branded their foes   House  economic arsonists  thereby gained political traction.

McCarthy needs  reverse  equation, which   ’ trying  portray Biden  stubborn  refusing  negotiate concessions  raising  debt ceiling. The   haven’    last 75 days   White House  sticking   position that  place  talks  over  budget – which House Republicans    produce –   with  full faith  credit   US government   line  with America’ reputation   financial haven  stake.

McCarthy , therefore,   bind. Congress,   president,   power  raise  government’ borrowing limit. Yet  speaker  demanding Biden give away  store over  duty that only McCarthy   lawmakers  fulfill. No  would benefit from  default – especially   president likely heading into  reelection race. But ’ hard    McCarthy  emerge from this conundrum   winner   triggers  economic meltdown.

The White House twisted that particular knife  Monday.

“There   responsible solution   debt limit: addressing  promptly, without brinksmanship  hostage taking –  Republicans  three times   last administration   Presidents Trump  Reagan argued   office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.

Republicans   Senate have   tried  avoid  mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell   least give  colleague   House some moral support  Monday when  returned   Capitol after convalescing after  fall.

“President Biden does    stick  fingers   ears  refuse  listen, talk  negotiate. And  American people know that. The White House needs  stop wasting time  start negotiating with  Speaker   House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’ volunteer   involved.

McCarthy’ speech  Monday only furthered  impression that  damaging political crisis over  debt ceiling , after months  simmering, moving toward  boil.

As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  New York    Monday: “He went     Wall Street  gave   more details,  more facts,   information,  I’  blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues  this direction   headed  default.”

“In some schools there  little   misuse  stimulants, while  other schools more than 25%  students  used stimulants  nonmedical ways,” said McCabe,   also  professor  nursing   University  Michigan School  Nursing. “This study   major wake- call.”

Nonmedical uses  stimulants  include taking more than  normal dose   high,  taking  medication with alcohol  other drugs  boost  high, prior studies have found.

Students also overuse medications  “  pill that someone gave them    sense  stress around academics — they  trying  stay  late  study  finish papers,” said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director  pediatric programs   Yale Program  Addiction Medicine  New Haven, Connecticut.

“We know this  happening  colleges. A major takeaway    study  that misuse  sharing  stimulant prescription medications  happening  middle  high schools,  just college,” said Camenga,    involved with  study.

Wide range  abuse

Published Tuesday   journal JAMA Network Open,  study analyzed data collected between 2005  2020  Monitoring  Future,  federal survey that  measured drug  alcohol  among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.

In  data  used  this study, questionnaires were given  more than 230,000 teens  eighth, 10th  12th grades   nationally representative sample  3,284 secondary schools.

Schools with  highest rates  teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely  have students misusing prescription stimulants during  past year,  study found. Schools with    students currently using such treatments  much less   issue,   didn’ disappear, McCabe said.

“We know that   biggest sources  leftover medications, perhaps from family members such  siblings,  asking peers,   attend other schools,”  said.

In addition, adolescents  said they used ADHD medications currently    past were about 2.5% more likely  have misused  stimulants when compared with peers   never used stimulants,  study found.

“But these findings were  being driven solely  teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found  significant association, even when  excluded students  were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”

Data collection   study  through 2020. Since then,  statistics show prescriptions  stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most  groups. At  same time, there  been  nationwide shortage  Adderall,    most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable  fill  refill their prescriptions.

“Finally,  parents suspect  type  misuse, they should contact their child’ prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should  screened  assessed immediately.”

Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas  Tuesday amid reports that  Supreme Court conservative failed  disclose luxury travel, gifts   real estate transaction involving  GOP megadonor,  their plan  investigate  conservative jurist remains unclear.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin  promised that  committee will hold  hearing   alleged ethics violations   coming weeks,  shared  details when pressed  CNN  whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas  others  might have knowledge about  relationship with  donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.

Asked  subpoenas were   table, Durbin said that  decision  been made  that . He said that   “ soon”  share more information about what  committee’ hearing  Supreme Court ethics might look like. He  other Judiciary Democrats sent  letter  Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling    open  investigation into  Thomas allegations.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal,  Connecticut Democrat  sits   Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “ American people deserve    facts surrounding Justice Thomas’ blatant violation  .”

“I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear,   ,  should consider subpoenas    others, like Harlan Crow,  have information,” Blumenthal said.

Other Democrats   committee said Tuesday that they were deferring  Durbin,  huddled with Democrats  Monday evening  discuss their strategy towards Thomas.

Meanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united  defending  Thomas, suggesting  court  handle   affairs.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats  criticizing  court,  said   confidence  Roberts “ deal with these court internal issues.”

“The Democrats,  seems  , spent    time criticizing individual members   court  going after  court   institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.

Bringing more transparency   high court   some bipartisan support   past,   court’ jerk   right – particularly with  three justices that former President Donald Trump    bench –  raised  partisan stakes around  issue. In recent years,  conservative majority  handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling  regulations  reining   powers  executive branch agencies –  prompting outcry from Democrats.

Even  Senate Democrats have   settle   plan  their  response   Thomas allegations, they sought  highlight  issue  framed  within their broader push   code--ethics   Supreme Court, which  excluded from many   ethics rules that apply  lower rungs   federal judiciary.

“I’ disturbed   recent reports detailing potentially unethical – even potentially illegal conduct –   highest levels   judiciary,” Sen. Alex Padilla,  California Democrat, said   Judiciary Committee hearing  three lower court nominees  Tuesday. “It should  without saying that judges   levels should  held  strict  enforceable ethical standards.”

Durbin said   speech that Congress shouldn’ have  wait   court  .

“The Supreme Court doesn’ need  wait  Congress  clean   ;  justices could take action today  they wanted ,    court fails  , Congress must,” Durbin,  Illinois Democrat, said   Senate floor Tuesday.

Back- back-reports  ProPublica this month detailed  luxury travel  gifts  Thomas from Crow –  even  real estate transaction – went unreported  Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.

Thomas  said that  travel  gifts     family that were financed   Crows went unreported because   been advised that    required   , under  exemption   court’ disclosure rules  -called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny  those rules  lawmakers,  Judicial Conference – which operates   policy-making body   federal judiciary – recently closed  loophole  those rules that appears  have covered some   hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that  intended  follow that updated guidance   future,   source close   justice also told CNN  recent days that  planned  amend  disclosure form  report  real estate transaction,  sale   mother’ home  Crow.

“If  reports  accurate,  stinks,” Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening,  rare comments from  Republican criticizing Thomas’ lack  transparency.

Republicans defend Thomas   SCOTUS  address ethics internally

Other Republicans lined   defense   justice –   named   Supreme Court  President George H.W. Bush  1991 –  said  wasn’ Congress’ place  push  ethics code   high court.

Sen. Josh Hawley,  Republican member   Judiciary Committee, suggested that  accusations against Thomas were part   “multi-decade effort   target Clarence Thomas  these liberal activist groups.”

This    first time Thomas  been   center   ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that  wife Ginni Thomas,  conservative activist,  texting with Trump White House chief  staff Mark Meadows about  former president’ efforts overturn  2020 election defeat,   political lobbying  long raised questions about when justices  obligated  recuse themselves from cases.

Yet Republicans have shown little interest  joining Democrats  using legislation  impose  ethics code   justices.

“The Court, kind  historically I think,  sort  policed itself,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune,  GOP’ Senate Whip,  said Thomas  been  “solid justice   court through  years   acquitted himself well there.”

“Let’  what  court does,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Republican   Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. “I prefer them    internally.”

As time  passed, adults with reduced immune function because  their    underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose   bivalent vaccines.

High speed trains have proved their worth across  world over  past 50 years.

It’  just  reducing journey times,  more importantly, ’  driving economic growth, creating jobs  bringing communities closer together. China, Japan  Europe lead  .

So  doesn’  United States have  high-speed rail network like those?

For  richest  most economically successful nation   planet, with  increasingly urbanized population  more than 300 million, ’  position that  becoming more difficult  justify.

Although Japan started  trend with  Shinkansen “Bullet Trains”  1964,    advent  France’ TGV   early 1980s that really kick-started  global high-speed train revolution that continues  gather pace.

But ’  revolution that    bypassed  United States. Americans  still almost entirely reliant  congested highways   headache-inducing stress   airport  airline network prone  meltdowns.

China  built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers)  dedicated high-speed railways since 2008  plans   43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers)  2035.

Meanwhile,  United States  just 375 route-miles  track cleared  operation  more than 100 .

“Many Americans have  concept  high-speed rail  fail    value. They  hopelessly stuck with  highway  airline mindset,” says William C. Vantuono, editor--chief  Railway Age, North America’ oldest railroad industry publication.

Cars  airliners have dominated long-distance travel   United States since  1950s, rapidly usurping  network  luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such  “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief”  “Silver Comet.”

Deserted  Hollywood movie stars  business travelers, famous railroads such   New York Central were largely bankrupt   early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains  Amtrak,  national passenger train operator founded  1971.

In  decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems  have been  very  priority  US lawmakers.

Powerful airline,   auto industry lobbies  Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority,  their position  weakening   face  environmental concerns  worsening congestion.

Billions  rail improvements

US President Joe Biden’ $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill includes  unprecedented $170 billion  improving railroads.

Some  this will  invested  repairing Amtrak’ crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York  Washington.

There  also  plans  bring passenger trains back  many more cities across  nation – providing fast, sustainable travel  cities  regions that have  seen  passenger train  decades.

Add  this  success   privately funded Brightline operation  Florida, which  been given  green light  build  $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles  Las Vegas  2027, plus schemes  California, Texas   proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle  Vancouver,   United States  last appears     cusp   passenger rail revolution.

Bigger investment

“Every president since Ronald Reagan  talked about  pressing need  improve infrastructure across  USA,  they’ always  other, bigger priorities  deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer  train builder Alstom’ US division.

“But  there’  huge impetus   things moving – ’  time  optimism. If  build , they will come. As  industry, ’ maturing,  ’ ready  take  next step. It’ time  focus  passenger rail.”

Sherin points  that other public services such  highways  airports  “massively subsidized,”  there shouldn’   issue with doing  same  rail.

“We need    better   articulating  benefits  high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines –  that will help   build bipartisan support,”  adds. “High-speed rail    solution  everything,     place.”

Only Amtrak’ Northeast Corridor  trains that  travel  speeds approaching those   300 kilometers  hour (186 ) TGV  Shinkansen.

Even here, Amtrak Acela trains currently    150  –  only  short bursts. Maximum speeds elsewhere  closer  100   congested tracks shared with commuter  freight trains.

New generation  trains

This year, Amtrak plans  introduce   generation Avelia Liberty trains  replace  life-expired Acelas   NEC.

Capable  reaching 220  (although they’  limited  160    NEC),  trains will bring Alstom’ latest high-speed rail technology  North America.

The locomotives  each  – known  power cars –  close relatives   next generation TGV-M trains, scheduled  debut  France  2024.

Sitting between  power cars   passenger vehicles, which  Alstom’ Tiltronix technology   faster through curves  tilting their bodies, much like  MotoGP rider does. And ’  just travelers  will benefit.

“When Amtrak awarded  contract  Alstom  2015  2016,  company  around 200 employees  Hornell,” says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor   city  Hornell  New York state.

“That figure   nearer 900, with hiring continuing   fast pace. I calculate that there  been  total public/private investment  more than $269 million   city since 2016, including   hotel,  state--- hospital  housing developments.

“It   transformative economic development project that  basically unheard   rural America     happen here,   happen throughout  United States.”

Alstom  spent almost $600 million  building  US supply chain   high-speed trains – more than 80%   train  made   United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.

“High-speed rail  already here. Avelia Liberty  designed jointly with  European colleagues,   have what  need  ‘TGV-USA’,” adds Sherin.

“It’  proven tech from existing trains. We’ ready   when  infrastructure arrives.”

And those  lines could arrive sooner than  might think.

Incoming high-speed lines

In March, Brightline confirmed plans  begin construction   218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles,  Las Vegas, carving  path through  San Bernardino Mountains  across  desert, following  Interstate 15 corridor.

The 200  line will slash times  little more than  hour –  massive advantage over  four-hour average    five  seven hours   – when  opens  2027.

Mike Reininger, CEO  Brightline Holdings, says: “As  most shovel-ready high-speed rail project   United States,    step closer  leveling  playing field against transit  infrastructure projects around  world,    proud   using America’ most skilled workers   there.”

Brightline West expects  inject around $10 billion worth  benefits into  region’ economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs,  well  1,000 permanent jobs  maintenance, operations  customer service  Southern California  Nevada.

It will also mark  return  passenger trains  Las Vegas after  30-year hiatus – Amtrak canceled  “Desert Wind” route  1997.

Brightline hopes  attract around 12 million   50 million - trips taken annually between Las Vegas  LA, 85%  which  taken    .

Another California project

Meanwhile, construction  progressing  another high-speed line through  San Joaquin Valley.

Set  open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will  from Merced  Bakersfield (171 miles)  speeds    220 .

Coupled with proposed upgrades  commuter rail lines  either , this project could eventually allow high-speed trains    350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles  San Francisco metropolitan areas  just  hours  40 minutes.

CHSR  been   table   back  1996,   implementation  been controversial.

Disagreements over  route, management issues, delays  land acquisition  construction, cost over-runs  inadequate funding  completing  entire system have plagued  project – despite  economic benefits  will deliver  well  reducing pollution  congestion. Around 10,000 people  already employed   project.

Costing $63 billion  $98 billion, depending   final extent   scheme, CHSR   connect    10 largest cities   state  provide  same capacity  4,200 miles   highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates    airport runways costing between $122 billion  $199 billion.

With California’ population expected  grow  more than 45 million  2050, high-speed rail offers  best value solution  keep  state from grinding   smoggy halt.

Corridors   greatest potential

Brightline West  CHSR offer templates   future expansion  high-speed rail  North America.

By focusing  pairs  cities  regions that   close   travel    apart   drivers, transportation planners  predict which corridors offer  greatest potential.

“It’ logical that  US hasn’  developed  nationwide high-speed network,” says Sherin. “For decades, traveling   wasn’  hardship,   highway congestion gets worse, ’ reached  stage where  should start looking more seriously   alternatives.

“The magic numbers  centers  population with around three million people that  200  500 miles apart, giving  trip time  less than three hours – preferably  hours.

“Where those conditions apply  Europe  Asia, high-speed rail reduces ’ share   market from 100%  near zero. The model would work just  well   USA   does globally.”

Pipe dream?

Sherin points   success   original generation  Acela trains  evidence  this.

“When  first generation Acela trains started running between New York City  Washington  2000, Amtrak attracted  many travelers that  airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between   cities,”  adds.

However, industry observer Vantuono  more pessimistic.

“A US high-speed rail network   pipe dream,”  says. “A lack  political support  federal financial support combined with  kind  fierce landowner opposition that CHSR  faced  California means that  challenges   high-speed projects  enormous.”

According   International Energy Agency (IEA), urban  high-speed rail hold “major promise  unlock substantial benefits”  reducing global transport emissions.

Despite  advent  cars  airplanes, rail   types  continued  evolve  thrive. Fatih Birol, IEA executive director

Dr. Fatih Birol,  IEA’ executive director, argues that rail transport  “often neglected”  public debates about future transport systems –  this  especially true  North America.

“Despite  advent  cars  airplanes, rail   types  continued  evolve  thrive,” adds Birol.

Globally, around three-quarters  rail passenger movements  made  electric-powered vehicles, putting  mode   unique position  take advantage   rise  renewable energy over  coming decades.

Here, ,  United States lags  behind  rest   world, with electrification almost unheard  away from  NEC.

Rail networks  South Korea, Japan, Europe, China  Russia  more than 60% electrified, according  IEA figures,  highest share  track electrification being South Korea  around 85%.

In North America,   other hand, less than 5%  rail routes  electrified.

The enormous size   United States   widely dispersed population mitigates against  creation   single, unified network   type being built  China  proposed  Europe.

Air travel  likely  remain  preferred option  transcontinental journeys that   more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).

But there  many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail,   combination   infrastructure  upgraded railroad tracks  tilting trains, could eventually provide  unbeatable alternative   travel  highways.

Audie Cornish 00:08:50 And when ' around Nashville   have political conversations, wherever  person falls   spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this  The South.

Ketch Secor 00:09:03 Yeah. And whether ' supposed   that  ,  know, I think '   state  considerable growth down south,   vestiges remain,  they' important  talk about  this regard, because    vestiges   culture,  ' largely considered like  rebel flag   past, just something that exists here. Deal with , '. When  fact,  have always   power  drop  rebel flag. There'  vestige that  been challenged effectively.

Audie Cornish 00:09:40 And effected change   ,   least raise  kind  societal stakes engaging  certain language.

Ketch Secor 00:09:48 Totally. And  I   change   culture  just like another step towards The South' evolution.

Audie Cornish 00:09:57 To  mind, country, Americana, these genres  closely align with their audiences. It' very much like -, like people  - talk about  culture  their ties   music,   music ties  quite literally  identity   people listening. And country feels very much  same . But   result,      like rules. You know, there'  couple lines  they people ' like   step  . Can  talk about  that plays   modern country?

Ketch Secor 00:10:30 Sure. Well, today' country singer might  come from The South   college educated. So that they'   already changed  stereotype   sings country music. You know, ' '  coal miners anymore. The coal miner' daughter like   love Loretta,  that'  '  number  right . So that part    changed  . But what hasn' changed  much   attitudes   audience.

Audie Cornish 00:10:59 Which   clear. The country music audience also  wealthier   decision makers   often managers, there' been sort  like    research into many people     audience,   audience probably looks  little different than people expect  well.

Ketch Secor 00:11:15 Well, I didn' know   into this,   I' excited that  , Audie, because,  know, country music really especially,   clarify, contemporary country music   radio   real safe space     talk about political divisiveness   talk about things   substance. But instead '  sort  reading  Pulp Fiction together. And ' '

Audie Cornish 00:11:42 Which   ' popular, right? I mean, during  pandemic, I heard  growth  listening   music  streaming maybe   15%. It  higher than  other genre.

Ketch Secor 00:11:52 It' love stories.

Audie Cornish 00:11:52 People welcome that safe space.

Ketch Secor 00:11:54 Travel story. It'  know, ' very much stories, intergenerational family tales. That'  kind  stuff that goes number    song about grandpa  what  good        could   little  more like , then  world would   better place. So this sort ,  know, hallmark kind  these ideals that  tossed around might   that realistic  today' reality ,  know, I worked I' part   global economy working  jobs. And,  know, I' hoping  kids  going      state tuition  whatever. And   country music really deals  nostalgia. And that nostalgia    important antidote     pain that   witness   click   mouse.

Audie Cornish 00:12:44 Right. So  does . Culture interact with that nostalgia, storytelling, because ' saying    that that' built into  music, .

Ketch Secor 00:12:55 Johnny Cash singing I Shot  Man  Reno  Watch Him Die. Hank Jr Singing about. Yeah, I' like  spit some beach   that dude'   shoot  with   45 because  country   survive. This      country music  retain authority   changing world. And guns--

Audie Cornish 00:13:16 But   hear    modern music? Are there? You ' have  pick   artist. But  people still talk about that?

Ketch Secor 00:13:24 No, Audie. And that'  thing. We ' talk about guns. If  , '  song about I took   hunting   first time. It' again, dealing   nostalgia. What '  saying  I'   AR-15   collection. But  reality  that many, many listeners . And  '  safe space where they   confronted   music   changing reality. Instead, they  allowed  , I taught  child  ,  know, I mean, when I      eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned   fire  weapon. I learned   clean  weapon. These things  important   ways that  culture    positive,   safe space  that '  talking about what  means  today' America. Instead, ' pretty much hanging  yesterday'.

Audie Cornish 00:14:15 So what   like  artists such  yourself  raise this issue?

Ketch Secor 00:14:24 People keep saying, thanks  being brave. And I' like. You know ' brave    that pulled  fire alarm,  know,   hallway under gunfire   town   school,   that   third grader. Now, that' brave. All I' doing  just I'  singer  I' going  sing about  stuff that' real. I'  writer,  I' going  tell what I .

Audie Cornish 00:14:52 I ' want  read  much into  zoom,  I. Are  getting emotional talking about that?

Ketch Secor 00:14:57 Oh, yeah. I mean, I' been I' been crying   weeks, ', like '... When this comes  your town  they bury  same    yours. And then  then, like, while  graves  still fresh,  news cycle moves   Stormy Daniels,  that'  reality. It' like, Good God, where   live? What    care about kids  ? It' just over. So this     saying '  over   '  over until those deaths, those three deaths  American children gunned down   third grade, until they mean something, that' when '  over.

Audie Cornish 00:15:51 More with Ketch Secor  just  moment.

Audie Cornish 00:15:57 You  demanding   kind  movement come    south. And that   part    people   cultural figures  well,  just politicians, people such  yourself. Why   think  could make  difference?

Ketch Secor 00:16:14 Well, I think that Nashville stands uniquely poised  lead  response   school shooting epidemic.

Audie Cornish 00:16:22 But    think that? Right? We just watched  Tennessee State House expel  members because they   protest related   policy. Expel,  censure,  reprimand. Try  kick them . So what what  your mind leads   think that?

Ketch Secor 00:16:41 Well, Nashville, despite  fact that  state legislature  what  , Nashville   very progressive city. And I'  saying that Tennessee  going  lead  . I' saying Nashville.

Audie Cornish 00:16:55 Yeah,  ' that  tough part? If   these states  '  just Tennessee, '  these blue cities, these little blue dots     ,    I mean very conservative, very -, -Second Amendment legislatures. This sounds like  uphill battle. What ' calling .

Ketch Secor 00:17:19 Yes.

Audie Cornish 00:17:19 And I know ' worth . I ' want  because   know ' worth . But I want I want  understand   think country musicians     uniquely positioned  have this conversation.

Ketch Secor 00:17:32 Well,  I want  I appreciate  challenging this Audie. First thing I want    that changing segregation   uphill battle  Tennessee. And  when Nashville   early 1960s,   late 1950s said  first foot forward, this   proving ground, other parts   South were  unsafe. But people gathered  Nashville,  city  colleges,  city  progressive thought   South  engage  nonviolent civil disobedience. This  where John Lewis came. This  where  Freedom Riders first stop .

Audie Cornish 00:18:09 Their trainings, right, with James Lawson   Vanderbilt.

Ketch Secor 00:18:12 All  that training  Fisk  Vanderbilt happened right here  Nashville, Tennessee. That shows  ability     community  exist outside   state. Now, just like  that time,  state legislator said, what   talking about? That'  going  happen   state. We cast  deciding vote   women' suffrage. I mean, Tennessee  been  bellwether place  these  other instances  great significance. This   third. This   part   death knell    South, which  going  have  change. You know, 50 years from  I think ' going   looking back  these couple  years   deciding time   assault weapons    United States.

Audie Cornish 00:18:59 Again, I want  bring    question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones  given what  know about  music, number , have been socially punished  activism  what  call Music Row,  music radio,  country music radio  particular, which still   very kind  strong grip    programmers ,  even recent history. Right. When  think about  Dixie Chicks, ., their whole story   story  being ostracized  their activism.

Ketch Secor 00:19:34 You know,    like , I'  beholden   many people  ,  I'   mainstream. I'    Jumbotron,  know, I'    awards show with    performers   year.

Audie Cornish 00:19:49 Do  need those people   movement ' talking about?

Ketch Secor 00:19:53 They have  really  reach   power  accelerate  inevitable movement  change this   kids. And I' asking them through this piece  also face  face   community, through conversations  text. You know, I' reached    many singers   past  weeks.

Audie Cornish 00:20:18 And what kind  text  send.

Ketch Secor 00:20:20 Hey, I' just reaching     Nashville music community   wake   shooting  sharing this story that I wrote that came  today  The Times. If    , please take  look.

Audie Cornish 00:20:32 What' been  most positive response? What' been  most frustrating ?

Ketch Secor 00:20:37 The most frustrating   silence. I      piece that I think silence  complicity. I went into  studio  I  I recorded   song   subject. Since  shooting, which  only  weeks  there have been  many ways   engaged with this terrible story,  ' powerful solution.

Audie Cornish 00:21:00 I mean,  reason  I' asking  because your   said something pretty specific, right? That there  artists   tired  being   kind  mercy   whims  fearmongers,  said,  that they' ready  speak   impressionable audience. And because other genres, like  mentioned   earlier  , they  wade into societal issues. They   confrontational about politics. It'  like there '  model  there. So I guess what would  take,   think,  people  your industry? To start   something similar, which  which ,  effect, what ' calling .

Ketch Secor 00:21:39 It  beginning  ', I think,   infancy,  ' already started.

Ketch Secor 00:21:45 Mm .

Audie Cornish 00:21:45 And  ' about fanning  flames  building   bonfire   what' already crackling kindling. For example, '   benefit concert here  Nashville that supports Covenant School. And when  look    roster, '   marquee, '   usual Americana folks  always ,  know,  stand with kids,  stand  against  violence. Instead, ' number  chart toppers. They  there. They have  their  into  ring.

Audie Cornish 00:22:19 But   because '   going    safe space from politics? If '  moment   memorial,  that what makes  okay    artist   there? Right. Because nobody' going       should have  control.

Ketch Secor 00:22:34 There' nothing   here because   have started   very baseline where music coming   Nashville   radio says nothing about violence against children   schools  about  need  rethink  types  weaponry that  associated with  Second Amendment. Kelsea Ballerini talked about    award show. These   kinds  things that when somebody takes  step   movement  quickly follow , then  next step '  hard  make. And what I' asking   that next step. You know, I' gotten    feedback from  audience. And like I      piece,  know, I   NRA sticker   back    trucks blaring   tunes. So,  know,  '    road with Hank Jr. this summer. So, I mean, I' I' used  playing   audience that   country folk. But I love  country folk audience. And I  I want   able   real with them. I  move freely  both   spaces that    silos   country. Like, I might   work   silo  come home   other . And I' good with that because I love those people.

Audie Cornish 00:23:55 What  your message  those artists   just still very reluctant?

Ketch Secor 00:24:00 Country music   great destiny  these times  swing  past  fences that have corralled    tightly. That I believe  this genre. And I believe that    power  carry that truth. You know, ' very much rooted   gospel tradition    lamentation,  calling    great spirits. Help , Lord. We' just your children. We ' know shit. We' ' dying down here. Help!

Audie Cornish 00:24:33 Can  talk about  song that ' written   this moment?

Ketch Secor 00:24:38 New material? You know, generally, just like I'   songwriting mood here, I'    moment  time with    different opportunities   writer  engage  this, whether ',  know, writing  right caption   photograph  Instagram  writing    piece  The New York Times  being  this podcast with , Audie. There'  many ways  choose  words right     have them  resonant   pain that ' feeling  Nashville, Tennessee  around  country because   just  tired, parents, that  kids   safe  their schools. What that means     songwriter  that I also have  chance  write  music about this     money where  mouth . So I    song that' coming  called Louder Than Guns. That' yeah, I just recorded   days .

Audie Cornish 00:25:33 Give   sense   tune  lyrics.

Ketch Secor 00:25:37 Well, gosh, I feel like I shouldn' even brought   because ' ...anytime     know, people  cagey about their  stuff!

Audie Cornish 00:25:46 Oh, I !

Editor’ Note: This   updated version   story that originally   April 14, 2023.

New York CNN —

It’ April 18,  official deadline  file your federal  state income  returns  2022. (It  also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day  those  celebrate.)

Whether  have already filed your  return  still need ,  good news  this  filing season  gone much more smoothly than  past three, which were hurt   pandemic.

“This   first  season since 2019 where  IRS   nation were  normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said   call with reporters.

For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks   infusion  some  funding after years  budget cuts, IRS employees have been able  answer 87%  calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And  wait times  those phone calls dropped  just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.

The agency also added  roster   online tools  filers,  added.

Still haven’ filed?

Those online tools   especially helpful today    scrambling   your return  before midnight. Or,  ’ come   realization that  need  file   extension. Either , here  some  things  know:

Not everyone   file  April 18: If  live   federally declared disaster area, have  business there —  have relevant  documents stored  businesses  that area — ’ likely  IRS  already extended  filing  payment deadlines  . Here  where   find  specific extension dates  each disaster area.

Thanks  many rounds  extreme weather  recent months,  instance,  filers  most  California — which accounts  10%  15%   federal filers — have already been granted  extension until Oct. 16  file   , according   IRS spokesperson.

If ’   armed forces   currently  were recently stationed   combat zone,  filing  payment deadlines  your 2022 taxes  most likely extended  180 days. But your specific extended filing  payment deadlines will depend     leave ( left)  combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly,   made little   money last year (typically less than $12,950  single filers  $25,900  married couples),     required  file  return. But   want  anyway   think   eligible   refund thanks ,  instance, refundable  credits such   Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool  gauge whether   required  file this year.) You also  likely eligible   IRS Free File (intended  those with adjusted gross income  $73,000  less)   ’ cost   submit  return.

Your paycheck    your only source  income: If    full-time    think that   only income  made  have  report. But that’  necessarily .

Other potentially taxable  reportable income sources include:

Interest  your savings

Investment income (.., dividends  capital gains)

Pay  part-time  seasonal work,   side hustle

Unemployment income

Social Security benefits  distribution from  retirement account

Tips

Gambling winnings

Income from  rental property  

Organize your  documents: By   should have received every  document that third parties  required  send  (your employer, bank, brokerage, .).

If  ’ recall receiving  hard copy    form   mail, check your email  your online accounts —  document  have been sent   electronically.

Here  some    forms   have received:

The 1099-K  required   made more than $20,000  over 200 transactions during  year. (Next year  reporting threshold drops  $600.) But even   didn’   1099-K  still must report   income that  made over third-party platforms  2022.

“Be aware that there’  form  some taxable income, like proceeds from renting  your vacation property, meaning ’ responsible  reporting   your ,” according   Illinois CPA Society.

One very last-minute   reduce your 2022  bill: If ’ eligible  make  -deductible contribution   IRA  haven’ done   last year,  have until April 18  contribute   $6,000 ($7,000  ’ 50  older). That will reduce your  bill  augment your retirement savings.

Proofread your return before submitting : Do this whether ’ using  software  working with  professional  preparer.

Little mistakes  oversights delay  processing  your return (  issuance  your refund  ’ owed ). You want  avoid things like having  typo  your name, birth date, Social Security number  direct deposit number; choosing  wrong filing status (.., married  single); making  simple math error;  leaving  required field blank.

What     ’ file  April 18: If ’  able  file  time, fill  Form 4868 electronically   paper  send    later than today. You will  granted  automatic -month extension  file.

Note, however, that  extension  file    extension  . You will  charged interest (currently running  7%)   penalty   amount  still   2022  haven’ paid  April 18.

So   suspect  still   — perhaps   some income outside  your   which  wasn’ withheld      capital gain last year — approximate  much more    send that money   IRS     today.

You  choose     mail, attaching  check  your extension request form. Make sure your envelope  postmarked  later than April 18.

Or  more efficient route   what   electronically  IRS., said CPA Damien Martin,   partner  EY. If   that,  IRS notes  will  have  file  Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process  extension  time  file,”  agency notes   instructions.

If    electronically  directly from your bank account, which  free, select “extension”  then “ year 2022” when given  option.

You  also   credit  debit card,   will  charged  processing . Doing , though,  become much more costly than just     charge your  payment  ’  your credit card bill   full every month, since  likely   high interest rate  outstanding balances.

If  ’  what    full,  IRS does have some payment plan options. But  might  smart  first consult with  certified public accountant    preparer    enrolled agent  make sure   making  best choice  your circumstance.

If  still  income taxes  your state, remember that   need   through  similar exercise  filing   extension  making  payment  your state’ revenue department, Martin said.

Use this interactive  assistant  basic questions   have: The IRS provides  “interactive  assistant” that  help  answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining  your individual circumstance  income, deductions, credits  other technical questions.

Already filed?

If ’ already filed your return, ’ probably glad  have    rear view mirror. But   still have   questions about what’ ahead.

What about  refund? If     refund,  IRS typically sends  within 21 days  receiving your return. When yours does arrive,    smaller than last year, even  your financial life didn’ change much. That’ because  number  Covid-related  breaks expired.

So ,  average refund paid  $2,878   week ending April 7, down from $3,175   same point  last year’ filing season.

Will I  audited?: The reasons  methods  auditing  taxpayer  vary —  many audits result  “ change,” meaning  ’   owing anything more   IRS. But  thing  common   vast majority  US  filers: Audit rates  exceedingly .

For filers reporting incomes between $50,000  $200,000, only 0.1%  them were audited  2020, according   latest data from  IRS. Even  very high income filers, audit rates were quite : Just 0.4%  those reporting income  between $1 million  $5 million; 0.7%  those with income between $5 million  $10 million;  2.4%  returns with income over $10 million.

Looking ahead,  IRS commissioner noted   press call that  agency will  using money from  Inflation Reduction Act  bolster  compliance efforts  focus more  auditing high-income individuals — defined  making $400,000  more. As  filers with income below that level,  said    anticipate  change   likelihood they would  audited.

CNN —

It’  surprising fact that’ often overlooked   immigration debate.

Undocumented immigrants  billions  dollars  federal taxes annually, between  returns filed  taxes deducted from paychecks, experts estimate.

Here’  look   –   – this  happening.

Why some undocumented immigrants choose   taxes

The National Immigration Law Center breaks down  number  reasons  undocumented immigrants  taxes, including:

• It shows they’ complying with federal  laws.

• It  help them demonstrate “good moral character”  they later have  opportunity  legalize their immigration status.

• Tax return records could  used  document work history  presence   US, steps that  help them  eligible  legal immigration status   future  lawmakers pass immigration reform.

How some  taxes despite  having Social Security numbers

Critics  illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants   taxes  able    because they’ using stolen Social Security numbers. But millions  federal  dollars  paid every year  people  ’ have Social Security numbers  .

Instead, they file using what’ known   Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).

The Bipartisan Policy Center,  Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe  vast majority   returns filed with ITINs today  filed  undocumented immigrants.”

Some noncitizens  legally immigrated   United States also  taxes using this method.

In 2019, according   IRS, more than 2.5 million  returns were filed using ITINs, accounting  nearly $6 billion  taxes.

In addition   return filings, officials estimate that undocumented immigrants also contribute billions  Social Security annually through payroll  deductions. In 2010,  example,  Social Security Administration estimated that payments from unauthorized workers accounted  about $12 billion   revenue  Social Security.

Immigrant rights advocates  speaking   social media

In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts  Facebook, Twitter  TikTok during  season have drawn attention   issue.

“Undocumented immigrants  billions  taxes  fund programs they ’ access,”  National immigration Law Center wrote   series  recent social media posts.

In 2017, Belén Sisa’ post about  experience paying taxes went viral.

“Wanna tell  again  I should  deported, contribute nothing  only leech  this country while  1% wealthiest people  this country steal from  everyday?” wrote Sisa,    college student  Arizona   time.

The beneficiary   Deferred Action  Childhood Arrivals program later told CNN  felt   important  speak .

“I wanted  show people that ’ here,  that  come from  over  world,  that  contribute more than people think that  ,”  said.

Jose Antonio Vargas,  Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist ’ turned  struggles   undocumented immigrant into  platform  advocacy, took  break from finalizing  taxes  2019  share  experience  Twitter.

“Yes,”  wrote, “undocumented immigrants  helping fund  very systems that detain  deport .”

Tuesday  Tax Day  America,    most stressful days   year, when many taxpayers will finally  their procrastination, file their federal returns,  hope   refund from  IRS. But  many   nation’ wealthiest, ’ just another Tuesday.

Abigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro  Rod Coplin

Morris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz

Tax Day ’ just  filing deadline — ’ also  annual reminder that  ultra-rich exist   entirely separate world when  comes  taxes. For ,  loopholes  bigger   rates  sometimes lower. Meanwhile,  rich keep getting richer, with  wealth  billionaires  particular growing  more than $1.5 trillion over  last  years.

This status   unfair,  even more importantly, ’ unsustainable. Such high levels  inequality  pushing  economy   democracy  their breaking points. That’   should examine      country   long-term stability  prosperity. And  should start  ensuring that  ultra-rich  more  what they   country that made their success possible.

There  three changes    code that would help   just that:

Tax  types  income  same  high earners

Right ,  US  system values money over sweat. If  work hard  your money instead  earning  passively, ’ essentially penalized  . People  earn  salary  significantly higher  rates  their income than wealthy investors  passively earn capital gains income.

Inheriting money   even better deal. Thanks  former president Donald Trump’ 2017  ,  first $12.92 million ( $25.84 million   married couple)  completely exempt from  estate ,   stepped- basis loophole allows wealthy families  permanently erase millions  capital gains taxes  resetting  market value  those assets  their value   time   original owner’ death. With this,  becomes relatively simple   rich  inherit tens, even hundreds  millions  dollars,   almost nothing  taxes. Someone working  that money,   other hand, would  over  third    federal income taxes.

Why   have   code that says working people should  taxed more than wealthy investors  those   rich just  virtue  being born into  right family? At     , money  money, whether  worked    whether  inherited . As  heiress   investor,  should   paying lower  rates than people  earn their money from working.

It’ time    code  treat  income equally  taxing  capital gains over $1 million   same rates  ordinary income,  replacing  loophole-ridden estate  with  simpler inheritance  that treats inherited wealth  income.

Tax wealth  unrealized capital gains

We ’ just focus  income, however, because many   richest Americans earn basically  taxable income   kind   typical year. Capital gains  only taxed when assets  sold,  instead  selling them,  ultra-rich  their assets  collateral  borrow vast sums  money  extremely  interest rates  live ,  then declare little  even negative “income”  their  forms. This “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy   major reason billionaires paid  lower effective  rate over recent years than working-class families.

By rethinking what  taxable,    access   trillions  dollars  billionaire wealth that  untouchable under  current  structure. That’  President Biden  proposed  Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would   unrealized capital gains   wealthiest households   others have proposed wealth taxes  billionaires.

Tax  highest earners more

Finally,    most straightforward changes needed   simply   extremely rich more than  merely rich. Our income  caps     rate  37%   income over $578,125 ( $693,750  married couples). No matter  much more someone makes, they’ never  more than 37%  federal income taxes.

While someone earning $600,000  certainly making enough  live  very comfortable life, they’   different world than someone making $600 million  year. In order  reflect  real differences between  rich   ultra-rich,  need  return    rates   through  most prosperous decades   20th century   significantly more  brackets. They should reach   90%  people making more than $100 million  year.

These three changes certainly ’    country’ problems  their ,  they would   long   stopping  steady flow   country’ wealth toward  smaller  smaller group  people,  change that would make both  democracy   economy more stable. The  code    powerful tool  both social  economic change. We just need    more effectively.

China’ economy     solid start  2023,  consumers went   spending spree after three years  strict pandemic restrictions ended.

Gross domestic product grew  4.5%   first quarter from  year , according   National Bureau  Statistics  Tuesday. That beat  estimate  4% growth from  Reuters poll  economists.

But private investment barely budged  youth unemployment surged   second highest level  record, indicating  country’ private sector employers  still wary about longer term prospects.

Consumption posted  strongest rebound. Retail sales jumped 10.6%  March from  year earlier,  highest level  growth since June 2021. In  January  March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted   surge  revenue from  catering service industry.

“The combination   steady uptick  consumer confidence  well   still-incomplete release  pent- demand suggest   that  consumer- recovery still  room  ,” said Louise Loo, China lead economist  Oxford Economics.

After mass street protests gripped  country  local governments    cash   huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped  zero-Covid policy  December. Following  brief period  disruption    Covid surge,  economy  started showing signs  recovery.

Last month,  official gauge  -manufacturing activity jumped   highest level  more than  decade, suggesting  country’ crucial services sector  benefiting from  resurgence  consumer spending after    pandemic restrictions.

As  economic recovery gains traction, investment banks  international organizations have upgraded China’ growth forecasts  this year. In  World Economic Outlook released last week,  International Monetary Fund said China  “rebounding strongly” following  reopening   economy. The country’ GDP will grow 5.2% this year  5.1%  2024,  predicted.

Private business retreat

However, some analysts believe  strong growth reported   first quarter   product  “backloading”  economic activity from  fourth quarter  2022, which  weighed down  pandemic restrictions  then  chaotic reopening.

If adjustments  made  account   impact  delayed economic activity, GDP growth   first quarter could have been just 2.6%,  said.

Some  data released  Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment  extremely weak.

Fixed asset investment   private sector increased  mere 0.6% from January  March, indicating  lack  confidence among entrepreneurs. (State- investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That’ even worse than  0.8% growth recorded   January--February period.

The Chinese government  resorted  surprising measures  restore confidence among private entrepreneurs,   campaign  inspired more nervousness than optimism.

The -important property industry  also mired   deep downturn. Investment  property declined 5.8%   first quarter. Property sales  floor area decreased  1.8%.

“The domestic economy  recovering well,   constraints  insufficient demand  still obvious,” said Fu Linghui,  spokesman   NBS,   news conference  Beijing  Tuesday. “Prices  industrial products  still falling,  enterprises  facing many difficulties  their profitability.”

Youth unemployment surges

Unemployment continued  surge among  youth.

The jobless rate  16-  24-year-olds  19.6%  March,    third straight month. It   second highest  record, only behind  19.9% level reached  July 2022.

The high jobless rate among  youth suggests “slack   economy,” Yeung said.

“By June, there will    batch  graduates looking  jobs. The jobless condition could worsen further  China’ economic momentum falters,”  added.

China’ education ministry  previously estimated that  record 11.6 million college graduates will  looking  jobs this year.

At last month’ meeting   National People’ Congress,  country’ rubber-stamp parliament,  government   cautious growth plan  this year, with  GDP target  around 5%    creation target  12 million.

That’ because I took mifepristone years  during  miscarriage,   saved  life.

When I  prescribed mifepristone,     taken center stage  America’ abortion wars. I   have  make  rushed road trip across state lines    medicine, unlike many women  need  drug  live     many states that have restricted access  medication abortion  passed near-total bans  abortion.

I   forced     secret meet- with  stranger  order    medicine   black market,  several women I spoke  recently said they planned  . Nor  I have  order mifepristone online  find myself navigating  many scammers taking advantage   current patchwork  state abortion laws   US.

Mifepristone     drugs used   medication abortion   other, misoprostol,   subject   ruling   Texas judge. The  drugs   administered  someone having  miscarriage, allowing them  terminate  pregnancy when  fetus   viable.

It happened some years : After experiencing more than    hemorrhaging during  first trimester   pregnancy, I visited  -,  explained after examining  that  blood pressure  dropping rapidly   heavy bleeding I  experiencing   unmistakable sign   miscarriage.

For many women, being prescribed mifepristone  part  their routine medical care. Not    case: As  doctor explained, I  facing  dire medical emergency. I  grateful   medication that saved  life.

My miscarriage took   surprise. I  loved being pregnant  first time around, about  decade earlier. And   healthy woman, I   reason  fear when I became pregnant again. By  time I  administered mifepristone, I  losing  life that I  already begun  love. And like many other women, despite  level  education  economic status, I could  outrun  statistics that  Black women  higher risk.

Up    four known pregnancies will    miscarriage. And  Black women,  numbers  alarmingly higher. According   analysis  4.6 million pregnancies  seven countries,  risk   miscarriage  Black women  43% higher than  White women.

In  Black community, women have traditionally been taught  bear their burdens silently — keep your business  yourself — even after something  devastating  pregnancy loss. We  conditioned    I  back then,  keep  moving     outrun  long list  statistics that tell   lives   danger from every direction, whether   from health care risks  societal injustices  other stressors.

During  miscarriage, I   woman   afraid, hemorrhaging   excruciating pain,  desperate need  safe, emergency medical care. Thanks   administration  mifepristone, I  allowed dignity during  miscarriage. It’ what every woman deserves — whether   facing  potentially life-threatening miscarriage  seeking  abortion.

I learned from  experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access  whatever medicines  counseling  need  help  heal  that includes mifepristone. What  ’ need    criminalized  politicians  punitive reproductive laws that have long been   step with public opinion. Despite  continuing political attacks  women’ reproductive rights, more than 61%  US adults  abortion should  legal    most cases, according  Pew Research Center.

After  US Justice Department asked  Supreme Court  intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued  temporary order  preserve  status , ensuring access   drug while giving  justices more time  study  issue.

I  hoping  justices   politics aside  focus   science surrounding  safety  mifepristone,  drug that, thankfully, I  access  when  life   danger. Mifepristone,  synthetic steroid,  even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin  Viagra.

Following  science demands that, regardless  where  stand   issue  abortion, consideration must  made  cases like mine   millions  other women   years have safely used this medication  complications surrounding miscarriages.

We   know   legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across  nation –  blue   states alike –  watching. Punitive laws like   signed last week  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek  criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they  stripping   rights that  take  granted – ’ unlikely they will  prohibited    from making health care decisions about their  bodies.

It must . And I’ betting that whether   with  voice   votes, women will have  last word.

CNN —

When Ralph Nader   president  2000,  offered  simple rationale    that would ultimately help “spoil”  election   Democratic ticket I  privileged    with Al Gore. In Nader’ view,   parties were ideologically indistinguishable.

That argument  baseless. There were significant differences  policy between  George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket — which ended  victorious,  part thanks  Nader —  ours. For Nader, this wasn’ really about  “-party duopoly,”   coined . This  about  desire  push Gore   Democratic Party   left.

Today,  course,    reasonably argue that   parties aren’ ideologically distinct. The core problem  Washington, DC,  that they’  divided   much done.

Though  majority  Americans long    when Republicans  Democrats worked together  find bipartisan solutions   problems, many members  Congress refuse  work together  immigration,  debt ceiling  other issues critical   nation, even when bipartisanship     restore  common prosperity  security. Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling  House  Democrats  Senate, bipartisanship   only   pass  legislation.

While undoing  divisions plaguing  political system will   simple, there   step that   taken —   begins with giving voters  real alternative   2024 presidential election.

Most often, when Americans cast their votes  president  vice president, their ballot  only  viable tickets:  nominated   Democratic Party   other   Republican Party. But what would happen  they   third viable option?

The process  adding that third viable option   only arduous  time-consuming,   varies from state  state    District  Columbia.

Today, No Labels,  nonprofit organization that I -chair,  laying  groundwork  such  campaign  2024. Since early 2022,  team  been diligently working across  country  obtain ballot access   potential No Labels ticket, typically  collecting  certain number  petition signatures from voters  each state.

If   successful,  unity ticket — comprised   Democrat   Republican — could  presented  voters right next   Republican  Democratic nominees.

We think  this   insurance policy   country —  option   deployed ,  only , both    major party nominees fail  offer voters  choice  candidates they’ like  vote        partisan divisiveness that  dominates   nation’ capital. We will  consistently monitoring  sentiment  Americans through   research  polling,  well  public polling,  make that determination.

In this  several other ways, No Labels’ effort could   more different from  “spoiler” campaign that Nader attempted  decades .

First,  No Labels were  lend  ballot lines   presidential ticket,  presidential candidate would   Democrat   vice presidential candidate would   Republican,  vice versa. As such,  would appeal  some voters  might otherwise have voted   Democratic ticket,  other voters  might otherwise have voted   Republican ticket. And  would appeal  still other voters  would  have voted  either.

These nominees would  selected   diverse  distinguished group  citizens serving   committee —  would  ratified  delegates  would gather   No Labels National Convention planned  April 2024. This convention will occur about  weeks after  March 5th “Super Tuesday” primaries,   which historically  clarified   major party nominees will .

Second, No Labels’ 2024 effort   designed  push  Democratic nominees   left  Republican candidates   right. Rather, ’ intended  force   both parties  appeal  America’ growing commonsense majority. If they ’,  ballot line will create  opening   unity ticket that will.

According  recent polling  CNN,  number  individuals  identify  independent    rise,  comprising 41%   electorate — compared  only 28%  described themselves  Democrats  31%  described themselves  Republicans. These numbers  more evidence that there could   potential path  victory   independent ticket  2024.

But  there doesn’ appear   such  path   months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead   work  have done over  last decade  elect  organize members   House  Senate  have demonstrated  courage  reach across  aisle — including members   bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus.

It seems  Biden administration already   beginning  recognize  imperative  appealing   commonsense majority. President Joe Biden recently signed into   Republican measure  strike down  Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties  those  commit violent crimes,   announced more stringent border control policies.

Our hope  that  Republicans jockeying  their party’ nomination will similarly   need  reach  beyond their base instead  appealing  divisive policies  politics.

In  , No Labels hopes   have  offer  ballot line   independent unity ticket. We want  parties  come  their senses. But judging from  angry  apocalyptic reactions  strategists  both parties   thought  No Labels’ insurance policy,   clear that party leaders  know that there could   political cost  ignoring  commonsense majority. And that’  reason  hope   better future   government   country.

On Monday,  GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired  Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan —    hold  field hearing  New York City called “Victims  Violent Crime  Manhattan.” A statement bills  hearing   examination  ,  Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’ policies have “   increase  violent crime   dangerous community  New York City residents.”

Dean Obeidallah CNN

In response, Bragg’ office slammed Jordan’ hearing  “ political stunt” while noting that data released   New York Police Department shows crime  down  Manhattan with respect  murders, burglaries, robberies  more through April 2, compared with  same period last year.

In reality, this Jordan- hearing ’ about stopping crime  about defending Trump —   recently charged   Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded  guilty   criminal charges stemming from  investigation into  hush-money payment   adult film actress. The former president also  facing criminal probes  other jurisdictions over efforts  overturn  2020 election   handling  classified documents  Mar--Lago.

Bragg sued Jordan   committee last week  federal court, accusing  Judiciary Committee chairman   “transparent campaign  intimidate  attack”  office   investigation  prosecution  Trump  making demands  confidential documents  testimony.

While Jordan   committee appear focused  discrediting  investigation into Trump,  aren’ they looking into  recent bombshell reports  ProPublica that raised  flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After ,  House Judiciary Committee’ website explains that   jurisdiction over “matters relating   administration  justice  federal courts” –  which  revelations concerning Thomas  perfectly.

First,  learned  early April that Crow  provided Thomas   wife, Ginni,  decades with luxurious vacations including   donor’ yacht  private   faraway places such  Indonesia  New Zealand. That information  never revealed   public. (In  rare public statement, Thomas responded   advised   time that    have  report  trips. The justice said  guidelines  reporting personal hospitality have changed recently. “And,  ,  course,  intent  follow this guidance   future,”  said.)

Then  Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed  disclose  2014 real estate deal involving  sale  three properties    family owned  Savannah, Georgia,  that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One  Crow’ companies made  purchases  $133,363, according  ProPublica. A federal disclosure  passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices  other officials  make public  details  most real estate sales over $1,000.

As ProPublica detailed,  federal disclosure form Thomas filed  that year included  space  report  identity   buyer   private transaction,  Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics  experts told ProPublica that Thomas’ failure  report  appears    violation   . (Thomas   respond  questions from ProPublica   report; CNN reached    Supreme Court  Thomas  comment.)

The House Judiciary Committee  long addressed issues such  those surrounding Thomas. In fact,  committee  where investigations   impeachment  federal judges often commence.

One recent example came  2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom  committee investigated  recommended  impeachment.

The committee’ Task Force  Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements  representations under penalty  perjury, engaged   corrupt kickback scheme, solicited  accepted unlawful gifts,  intentionally misled  Senate during  confirmation proceedings.” The Senate later found Porteous guilty  four articles  impeachment  removed  from  bench.

Yet  Judiciary Committee  neither released statements  tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead,  Twitter feed  filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN ’ cover Monday’ New York field hearing. Worse,  committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Miller’ tweet defending Thomas  being attacked “because      deep faith,  loves  country  believes   Constitution.”

Jordan’    committee  assist Trump should surprise  . The House January 6 committee’ report called  Ohio Republican “ significant player  President Trump’ efforts”  overturn  election. The report detailed  lawmaker’ efforts  assist Trump including  “January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan   conference call  which , President Trump,  other Members  Congress discussed strategies  delaying  January 6th joint session.” As  result,  January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan  testify —   refused  cooperate.

In contrast with  House panel,  Senate Judiciary Committee — headed  Democrats — announced   wake   reporting  Thomas that  plans  hold  hearing “  need  restore confidence   Supreme Court’ ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse  Rhode Island  Rep. Hank Johnson  Georgia sent  letter Friday calling   referral  Thomas   US attorney general over “potential violations   Ethics  Government Act 1978.”

The House Judiciary Committee’ website notes, “The Committee   Judiciary  been called  lawyer   House  Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs   updated  state that  Committee   Judiciary   “ lawyer  Donald J. Trump.” And  worst part  that  taxpayers   ones paying  Jordan’ work  Trump’ behalf.

Four years , almost   ,  people  Sudan were celebrating  revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar -Bashir. Now  East African country faces  possibility   complete collapse similar   chaos   today  Yemen  Libya.

On Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other   capital  Khartoum. The  sides battled  control   nation’ airports, bases  military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into  streets  across  country.

Some 45 million Sudanese effectively  held hostage   unable  venture   their homes  fear  being killed   crossfire. At least 180 people have perished   fighting, including three World Food Programme humanitarian workers.

The conflict pits  bitter rivals  their powerful armed forces against each other. On  side   Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF),   Gen. Abdel Fattah -Burhan. On  other side   Rapid Support Forces (RSF),  paramilitary group   Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known  Hemeti.

There   good side  this conflict. Both have been accused   long litany  human rights violations.

How  Sudan  from casting  despotic rule  creating  fledgling democracy   years   teetering   brink  state collapse?

Revolution lost

On April 11, 2019, Sudan’ longtime dictator, Bashir,  overthrown. The cause  Bashir’ removal  months  protests   Sudan’ unions, which spurred  military coup from  SAF  RSF. Both Burhan  Hemeti joined forces  remove their former boss.

It   moment  promise because there  hope  democracy. I remember walking around  “-” —  giant carnival  freedom   middle  Khartoum that protesters  blocked   demand change. It  electric.

But social movements such   Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) —  union behind  protest — often struggle  translate  momentum  their demonstrations into real political power.

The reason  this ,  part, structural. Social movements such   SPA  often based  grassroots activism. A dictator  arrest    leaders   organization    entire country.

However, once  dictator  overthrown, these kinds  social movements often struggle  build  leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan’ protesters were unable  translate mobilization into political power.

Civilian leaders entered into  negotiation with  military over  future   country shortly after Bashir fell  April 2019. The  sides were  evenly matched. Because  these leadership challenges,  -democracy forces struggled  bargain with  disciplined military.

Any momentum that -democracy advocates  during  negotiations  stamped   June 2019 when RSF soldiers violently dispersed  -. More than 100 people were killed.

After  June massacre   leadership challenges,  transitional constitution  signed  August 2019 that gave  SAF  RSF most   power  Sudan. Burhan   head  state,  Hemeti  placed   elevated political position. Elections were promised  2022,   believed they would actually happen.

A legacy  autocracy

The transitional period began  August 2019,  I interviewed Abdalla Hamdok,  civilian prime minister, several times   book that I -wrote  Sudan’ revolution. The  that  constitution  written meant that Hamdok  limited power   prime minister. Burhan   head  state  wanted  preserve  powers   SAF.

Hamdok often told  that revolutions come  cycles. The 2019 removal  Bashir   high point  revolution,       making  many reforms  possible before   tide  counterrevolution swept  away.

Hamdok found that  legacy  30 years  dictatorship meant that Sudan’ political  economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan  Hemeti blocked   reforms that Hamdok wanted  make.

Outside Khartoum violence grew. Parts  Sudan such  Darfur    round  conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated  RSF troops. More than 430,000 people were displaced   conflict  Sudan, mostly  Darfur.

Soldiers   hide  atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking  with  soldier aligned with  RSF   house  Darfur   explained    recently participated   burning down   village from another ethnic group.

The soldier reasoned that  member   tribe  been killed   altercation,   RSF-aligned forces took revenge  torching  village that  been home  30,000 people. At least 163 people died.

Tensions between  SAF  RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti   RSF forces  upstart usurpers from Darfur  were undisciplined. Hemeti   other hand believed that   time  Darfur  lead Sudan.

Hamdok    cusp  beginning  turn  economy around when Burhan   SAF intervened. As  wrote   book “Sudan’ Unfinished Democracy,”  potential success   civilian government   much  Burhan. In October 2021, Hamdok  removed   military coup.

International delusion

After  October 2021 coup,  United States  United Nations pushed  worse version   transitional constitution  Sudan. They argued that    best   bring democracy.

The idea   restart  transitional period,  I  many others argued   shortsighted  wouldn’ work. Returning   government   Burhan  clearly  going  usher  democracy. If  plan ended   coup  first time,  would  work  second time?

Some activists stopped partnering with  US  came    UN mission   roadblock  democracy because  these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with  best American  foreign diplomats,  also understood  international policy  Sudan wouldn’ work. They   flaws  felt powerless  dissent  were forced  carry  decisions made many levels above them.

What preceded this weekend’ outbreak  clashes   controversial part   international policy that tried  unify  SAF  RSF. The idea   make  single army,  neither Hemeti  Burhan wanted  give   power they  amassed.

The plan  unify  military hadn’ worked  similar contexts. It   repeat   2013  2016 unification processes that took place  South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead,  tenuous relationship between Burhan  Hemeti boiled over    pressure.

What’ next?

It   easy  look   recent history  “revolutions”  countries such  Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt  Sudan  conclude that they eventually backfire. I ’ agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that  nation’ political fortune   active battle.

Of  many dark gifts Showtime’ eerie  series “Yellowjackets” serves   ,  juiciest this season     music.

The show – which bounces between  troupe  teen soccer players trapped   1990s Canadian wilderness after  plane crash   survivors’ corresponding adult selves   present  – embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from  tail   last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt  much more.

In Sunday’ episode  “Yellowjackets,” -rock queen Alanis Morissette will debut  version   show’ theme song, “No Return,”   already released    single.

One   most unexpected  successful uses  throwback music came   first episode  Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole’ Jeff   moment  himself    after  intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) – during which  rocks  hard  Papa Roach’ “Last Resort” (sure,  track actually came   2000,  that doesn’ take away from  retro vibe).

In  interview with CNN,  show’ music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that  Papa Roach song selection  scripted,  “served   perfect physical outlet  Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone   garage.”

Other standout moments   script, however,  hers  interpret,  Felder relishes  opportunity  match those moments with  right songs from  period.

“I -immerse myself into  show’   spirit   times  I start  build  playlists   show,”  said. “The main thing I   keep  mind   just stay true   story    tell  what  might need musically.”

Case  point, from  same episode –  placement  Amos’ signature track “Cornflake Girl,”   groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album “Under  Pink.”

The song – which appropriately   lyric “Things  getting kind  gross” just  teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse)  about  ingest something unthinkable – “came  mind pretty quickly   possibility”  Felder.

“I felt that Amos’ lyrics could serve   befitting launchpad   first episode’ ending –  only   reflection  Young Shauna’ state  mind,”  noted, “ also   reflection   past  present moods  mentalities lived    other ‘Yellowjackets’ characters  Season 2.”

Felder’ work  challenging,   sense that there  often  ideal wish-list selection   song during  certain moment  each script, which then might change either   something technical  because  needs   scene evolve during production,   result  many elements, including  actors’ performances.

“Everyone   team always wants  best song-select possible  enhance  story,”  said. “When    post (production),  common question that comes  among  during  collaboration process  simply, ‘Do  think   beat this?’”

During that collaborative process, Felder says  doesn’ “believe there   exact roadmap into   merge songs with  given scene  story.”

“I always , ‘Let  picture tell  what  needs.’ (Kind  like  Wilderness I guess?)”

Another moment that feels perfectly melded   music playing   -infamous ‘last supper’ scene from last week’ second episode, which boasts Radiohead’ “Climbing By The Walls” from their mindblowing 1995 album “OK Computer”   soundtrack.

“The song seems  refer  those unspeakable monsters that  live  ’ head,” Felder noted, referencing  strange collective hallucinations  group undergoes while cannibalizing   their . “I ’ think   more perfect   hauntingly accent (that) scene, ... ‘ feast.’”

To drive home just  important music    specific ambient feel  “Yellowjackets,”  need look  further than  super creepy Season 2 trailer   show, which features Florence + The Machine’ exceptional  haunting rendition  No Doubt’ timeless 1995 , “Just A Girl.”

“We tried  really  some horror elements  this iconic song    tone   show. And  someone ’ first musical love   punk  Gwen Stefani,    dream .”

Of  collaboration with “Yellowjackets,” Morrisette, , felt inspired   show.

“I  parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’   perspective while songwriting:  sheer intensity, that going   jugular with  fear around going   profane,” Morissette said   statement. “I’ strived  entire career  support  empowerment  women  sensitives,    world through  female lens,  what’  wonderful about this show  that each character  allowed   dynamic  complex  opposed  oversimplified, reduced versions  women.

Even though Israel eased  2 1/2-month blockade   territory  May,  groups  only  trickle  assistance  getting into  enclave  that Palestinians face catastrophic levels  hunger 21 months into  Israeli offensive launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

Despite  mounting desperation, there’ been  formal declaration  famine.

UN says Gaza’ hunger crisis  worsening

Gaza’ population  roughly 2 million Palestinians relies almost entirely  outside . Israel’ offensive  wiped  what  already limited local food production. Israel’ blockade, along with ongoing fighting  chaos inside  territory,  further limited people’ access  food.

The U.N. World Food Program says Gaza’ hunger crisis  reached “  astonishing levels  desperation.” Nearly 100,000 women  children  suffering from severe acute malnutrition,   third  Gaza’ population  going days without eating, Ross Smith,  agency’ director  emergencies, said Monday.

Gaza’ Health Ministry said Tuesday that more than 100 people have died while showing signs  hunger  malnutrition, mostly children.

It   give their exact cause  death. The ministry, part   Hamas- government,  staffed  medical professionals   figures   deaths  seen   U.N.  other experts   most reliable estimate  casualties.

Famine occurs when these conditions  

The leading international authority  food crises   Integrated Food Security Phase Classification,  IPC, first    2004 during  famine  Somalia. It includes more than  dozen U.N. agencies,  groups, governments  other bodies.

Famine  appear  pockets — sometimes small ones —   formal classification requires caution.

The IPC  only declared famine   times —  Somalia  2011,  South Sudan  2017  2020,  last year  parts  Sudan’ western Darfur region. Tens  thousands  believed  have died  Somalia  South Sudan.

It rates  area   famine when  least   three conditions  confirmed:

— 20%  households have  extreme lack  food,   essentially starving.

— At least 30%  children  months  five years  suffer from acute malnutrition  wasting, meaning they’  thin  their height.

— At least  people  four children under five  10,000  dying daily   starvation   interaction  malnutrition  disease.

Gaza poses  major challenge  experts because Israel severely limits access   territory, making  difficult   some cases impossible  gather data.

Famine declarations usually come from  U.N.  governments

While  IPC says    “primary mechanism” used   international community  conclude whether  famine  happening  projected,  typically doesn’ make such  declaration itself.

Often, U.N. officials together with governments will make  formal statement based   analysis from  IPC.

But  IPC says once  famine  declared ’ already  late. While   prevent further deaths,  means many people will have died   time  famine  declared.

It’  always clear that hunger   cause  death

Most cases  severe malnutrition  children arise through  combination  lack  nutrients along with  infection, leading  diarrhea  other symptoms that cause dehydration, said Alex  Waal, author  “Mass Starvation: The History  Future  Famine”  executive director   World Peace Foundation.

“There   standard guidelines  physicians  classify cause  death  ‘malnutrition’  opposed  infection,”  said.

When famine occurs, there  often relatively  deaths from hunger alone, with  more people dying from  combination  malnutrition, disease  other forms  deprivation. All  these count  excess deaths — separate from violence — that   attributed   food crisis  famine,  said.

The   made  hard   accurate information

Israel’ offensive  gutted Gaza’ health system  displaced some 90%   population. With hospitals damaged  overwhelmed   casualties,    difficult  screen people  malnutrition  collect precise data  deaths.

“Data  surveillance systems  incomplete  eroded,” said James Smith,  emergency doctor  lecturer  humanitarian policy   University College London  spent more than  months  Gaza.

“Which means that  health indicators —   death toll —  known    underestimation,”  said.

Even when famine  declared,  response   lacking

A declaration  famine should  theory galvanize  international community  rush food  those  need . But with  budgets already stretched,    politics throwing  obstacles, that doesn’ always happen.

“There    , huge bank account”  draw , said OCHA’ Laerke. “The fundamental problem  that  build  fire engine   respond.”

Aid groups  plenty  food  other   been gathered  Gaza’ borders,  Israel  allowing only  small amount  enter. Within Gaza, gunfire, chaos  looting have plagued  distribution  food.

The Israeli military says   facilitated  entry  some 4,500  trucks since -May. That’  below  600 trucks   that  groups   needed,  which entered during  -week ceasefire earlier this year. An Israeli-backed American contractor  also distributing food.

U.N. agencies  Israeli restrictions,   breakdown    order, make  difficult  distribute  food that does come .

“Only  massive scale-  food  distributions  stabilize this spiraling situation, calm anxieties  rebuild  trust within communities that more food  coming,”  World Food Program said over  weekend. “An agreed ceasefire  long overdue.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Department  Labor  aiming  rewrite  repeal more than 60 “obsolete” workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements  home health care workers  people with disabilities  standards governing exposure  harmful substances.

If approved,  wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions  constructions sites   mines,  limit  government’ ability  penalize employers  workers  injured  killed while engaging  inherently risky activities such  movie stunts  animal training.

The Labor Department says  goal   reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations,   deliver  President Donald Trump’ commitment  restore American prosperity through deregulation.

“The Department  Labor  proud  lead    eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth  limit opportunity,” Secretary  Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said   statement, which boasted  “most ambitious proposal  slash  tape   department across  federal government.”

Critics   proposals would  workers  greater risk  harm, with women  members  minority groups bearing  disproportionate impact.

“People   very great risk  dying    already,” Rebecca Reindel,  AFL-CIO union’ occupational safety  health director, said. “This  something that  only going  make  problem worse.”

The proposed changes have several stages   through before they  take effect, including  public comment period  each .

Here’  look  some   rollbacks under consideration:

No minimum wage  home health care workers

Home health care workers help elderly  medically fragile people  preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet , accompanying clients  doctor appointments  performing other tasks. Under    Labor Department’ proposals,  estimated 3.7 million workers employed  home care agencies could  paid below  federal minimum wage — currently $7.25  hour —  made ineligible  overtime   they aren’ covered  corresponding state laws.

The proposed rule would reverse changes made  2013 under former President Barack Obama  revert   regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that  lowering labor  compliance costs,  revisions might expand  home care market  help keep frail individuals  their homes  longer.

Judy Conti, director  government affairs   National Employment Law Project, said  organization plans  work hard  defeat  proposal. Home health workers  subject  injuries from lifting clients,  “before those (2013) regulations,   very common  home care workers  work 50, 60  maybe even more hours  week, without getting  overtime ,” Conti said.

Others endorse  proposal, including  Independent Women’ Forum,  conservative nonprofit based  Virginia. Women often bear  brunt  family caregiving responsibilities,  making home care more affordable would help women balance work  personal responsibilities,  group’ president, Carrie Lukas, said.

“We’ pleased    Trump administration moving forward  rolling back some  what    counterproductive micromanaging  relationships that were making  hard  people    care they need,” Lukas said.

Samantha Sanders, director  government affairs  advocacy   nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said  repeal would  constitute    women.

“Saying  actually ’ think they need those protections would  pretty devastating   workforce that performs really essential work   very heavily dominated  women,  women  color  particular,” Sanders said.

Protections  migrant farm workers

Last year,  Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections  migrant farmworkers  held H-2A visas. The current administration says most  those rules placed unnecessary  costly requirements  employers.

Under   proposal,  Labor Department would rescind  requirement  most employer-provided transportation  have seat belts  those agriculture workers.

The department  also proposing  reverse  2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation  activities such  filing  complaint, testifying  participating   investigation, hearing  proceeding.

“There’  long history  retaliation against workers  speak  against abuses  farm work. And with H-2A ’ even worse because  employer  just  renew your visa,” said Lori Johnson, senior attorney  Farmworker Justice.

Michael Marsh, president  CEO   National Council  Agricultural Employers, applauded  deregulation efforts, saying farmers were  with thousands  pages  regulations pertaining  migrant farmworkers  recent years.

“Can  imagine  farmer     spouse trying  navigate 3,000  pages  regulation  18 months  then  liable  every   them?”  asked.

Adequate lighting  construction spaces

The Occupational Safety  Health Administration, part   Labor Department, wants  rescind  requirement  employers  provide adequate lighting  construction sites, saying  regulation doesn’ substantially reduce  significant risk.

OSHA said  employers fail  correct lighting deficiencies  construction worksites,  agency  issue citations under  “general duty clause.” The clause requires employers  provide  place  employment free from recognized hazards which  likely  cause death  serious physical harm.

Worker advocates think getting    specific construction site requirement    idea. “There have been many fatalities where workers fall through  hole   floor, where there’  adequate lighting,” Reindel said. “It’  very obvious thing that employers should address,  unfortunately ’   those things where  need  standard,  ’ violated   time.”

Mine safety

Several proposals could impact safety procedures  mines. For example, employers have  submit plans  ventilation  preventing roof collapses  coal mines  review   Labor Department’ Mine Safety  Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers  require mine operators  take additional steps  improve those plans.

The Labor Department wants   that authority, saying  current regulations give  district manager  ability  draft  create laws without soliciting comments  action  Congress.

Similarly,  department  proposing  strip district managers  their ability  require changes  mine health  safety training programs.

Limiting OSHA’ reach

The general duty clause allows OSHA  punish employers  unsafe working conditions when there’  specific standard  place  cover  situation.

An OSHA proposal would exclude  agency from applying  clause  prohibit, restrict  penalize employers  “inherently risky professional activities that  intrinsic  professional, athletic,  entertainment occupations.”

A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers  journalists  among  types  workers  limitation would apply .

“It  simply  plausible  assert that Congress, when passing  Occupational Safety  Health Act, silently intended  authorize  Department  Labor  eliminate familiar sports  entertainment practices, such  punt returns   NFL, speeding  NASCAR,   whale show  SeaWorld,”  proposed rule reads.

Debbie Berkowitz,  served  OSHA chief  staff during  Obama administration, said  thinks limiting  agency’ enforcement authority would   mistake.

“Once  start taking that threat away,  could return  where they’ throw safety   wind, because there  other production pressures they have,” Berkowitz said.

But  persistence, even   weakened state, only made Osbourne more beloved.

--------------------------------------------------
Black Sabbath, ‘Paranoid’ (1970)

Black Sabbath’ best-known song,  highest-charting single, started    afterthought. The producer Rodger Bain asked  group  come  with  filler track    running time   second LP. In 20 minutes,   together  radio-ready rocker about   battling persistent mental malaise, inspired  bouts  depression that Butler  experiencing   time. Osbourne’ plaintive, high-pitched delivery soared over Iommi’ locomotive riffs,  drove home  pathos  lines like “Can  help  occupy  brain?” “Paranoid” would remain  staple   singer  close  50 years, closing  shows  both  final solo tour dates  2018, Sabbath’ farewell   year prior   Back   Beginning concert  performed this month  Birmingham. “None   thought   anything special when  recorded ,” Osbourne wrote   song   2009 memoir. “But [expletive] hell,   catchy.”

Black Sabbath, ‘Changes’ (1972)

Sabbath   softer side , epitomized  this piano-driven tear-jerker from “Vol. 4,”  template  numerous Ozzy ballads across  decades. The singer’ guileless whine easily adapted   R&B-esque feel   tune, collectively written   band  response   drummer’ romantic hardships. “Tony just  down  came  with this beautiful riff, I hummed  melody over  ,  Geezer wrote these heartbreaking lyrics about  breakup Bill  going through with  wife   time,” Osbourne recalled   memoir. “Changes” would have  long afterlife, revived both   duet between  singer   daughter Kelly,    veteran soul singer Charles Bradley   wrenching cover.

Following  firing from Sabbath,  depressed Osbourne assumed that  rock-star heyday  behind . But  chance meeting with Randy Rhoads —  classically trained virtuoso, then playing guitar  Quiet Riot — soon gave   powerful second wind. Osbourne hired Rhoads after  dazzling audition,   pair teamed with  bassist-lyricist Bob Daisley  write “Crazy Train,”  singer’ debut solo single  arguably  career-defining anthem. Daisley’ words alluded  political unrest   threat  ,  paired with Osbourne’ piercing belt  Rhoads’ triumphant riffs  finger-busting leads,  song sounded like  manifesto   life that  constantly  danger  jumping  tracks.

“Suicide Solution” will always  remembered   song that incited  legal  PR nightmare  Osbourne when  parents   California teen  died  suicide filed  suit — eventually dismissed — claiming their child  been influenced   track,  deep  from  singer’ solo debut, “Blizzard  Ozz.” But  Osbourne   -writer Daisley both maintained,  song  actually  warning against  dangers  alcoholism, inspired  part   death   AC/DC singer Bon Scott. (The word “solution”   title refers,   singer once explained,  “liquid,    .”) Musically,   another example   potency  Osbourne’ first solo band,   howled about  double-edged sword  intoxication — “Take  bottle  drown your sorrows/Then  floods away tomorrows” — over Rhoads’ swaggering riffs, which suggested  souped- Sabbath.

Rhoads’ tragic 1982 death   private-plane crash marked  another crossroads  Osbourne,   singer spent  rest   decade experimenting with lineups. “The Ultimate Sin,”  transitional fourth LP, yielded  moody, streamlined “Shot   Dark,”  first Osbourne solo single  crack  Billboard Hot 100. The song originated   years earlier with Wildlife —  band featuring  bassist Phil Soussan,  later signed  with Osbourne —  even  “Shot   Dark” wasn’ written  , Ozzy sells  expertly, fully inhabiting  sleek -metal feel.

‘Close My Eyes Forever,’ with Lita Ford (1988)

The only time Osbourne made  Top 10   U.S. singles chart  with this ballad about  tortured love affair,  duet with Lita Ford — then being managed  Sharon Osbourne — that grew    casual studio hangout  appeared   former Runaways guitarist’ third solo album. The pair’ voices  excellently matched, with Osbourne craning  some   highest notes  record while Ford favored  husky lower register. (Osbourne would later   less commercially successful duet with another female -star:  version  Steppenwolf’ “Born  Be Wild” featuring Miss Piggy.)
